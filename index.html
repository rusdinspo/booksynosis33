Yet they soon discover that the greatest obstacle to putting up a show on Broadway has nothing to do with their art, and everything to do with politics. A Red scare is sweeping across America, and Senator Joseph McCarthy has started a witch hunt for Communists, with those in the entertainment industry in the crosshairs.

Her writing has appeared in the New York Review of Books, New Yorker, Atlantic, Los Angeles Times and London Review of Books, among other publications. She lives in New Mexico.A fantastic book. We&#39;ve long understood the Little House series to be a great American story, but Caroline Fraser brings it unprecedented new context, as she masterfully chronicles the life of Laura Ingalls Wilder and her family alongside the complicated history of our nation. Prairie Fires represents a significant milestone in our understanding of Wilder&#39;s life, work, and legacy -- Wendy McClure, author of The Wilder Life: My Adventures in the Lost World of Little House on the Prairie In the twenty-first century, the tense and secret authorial partnership between Laura Ingalls Wilder and her daughter Rose Wilder Lane has emerged as the most complex and fascinating psychological saga of mother-daughter collaboration in American literary history. Caroline Fraser&#39;s deeply researched and stimulating biography analyzes their controversial relationship and places Wilder&#39;s influential fiction in the contexts of other myths of pioneer women and the frontier -- Elaine Showalter Engrossing... Exhilarating... Lovers of the series will delight in learning about real-life counterparts to classic fictional episodes, but, as Fraser emphasizes, the true story was often much harsher. Meticulously tracing the Ingalls and Wilder families&#39; experiences through public records and private documents, Fraser discovers failed farm ventures and constant money problems, as well as natural disasters even more terrifying and devastating in real life than in Wilder&#39;s writing * Publishers Weekly * Unforgettable... A magisterial biography, which surely must be called definitive. Richly documented (it contains 85 pages of notes), it is a compelling, beautifully written story.... One of the more interesting aspects of this wonderfully insightful book is its delineation of the fraught relationship between Wilder and her deeply disturbed, often suicidal daughter. But it is its marriage of biography and history - the latter providing such a rich context for the life - that is one of the great strengths of this indispensable book * Booklist, starred review * Fraser&#39;s meticulous, smart, historically informed biography shows where the books hew to - and diverge from - the facts of Wilder&#39;s long and eventful life...Fraser got a head start on her work for this biography when she edited the Library of America editions of Laura Ingalls Wilder&#39;s writing. Even readers who have already enjoyed those annotated volumes will find a trove of new material in Prairie Fires, which puts the books in a richer, more complicated context without undermining their value. Fraser concludes, &#34;They are not, as Wilder and her daughter had claimed, true in every particular. Yet the truth about our history is in them. ...Anyone who would ask where we came from and why, must reckon with them * Sarah Harrison Smith, the Amazon Book Review, An Amazon Best Book of November 2017 * The definitive biography...Magisterial and eloquent...A rich, provocative portrait * Star Tribune * An absorbing new biography [that] deserves recognition as an essential text.... For anyone who has drifted into thinking of Wilder&#39;s &#39;Little House&#39; books as relics of a distant and irrelevant past, reading Prairie Fires will provide a lasting cure.... Meanwhile, &#39;Little House&#39; devotees will appreciate the extraordinary care and energy Fraser devotes to uncovering the details of a life that has been expertly veiled by myth -- Patricia Nelson Limerick * New York Times Book Review * Caroline Fraser&#39;s expert account of both Laura and her troubled daughter Rose Wilder Lane, who is widely thought to have over-influenced her mother&#39;s oeuvre, minutely dissects their related lives and careers to explain and illustrate modern America&#39;s inviolate founding myth . . . should stand as the last word on a long life...Her story is everything you never knew and, now more than ever, need to understand about a defining element of the national character and the great American dream * Country Life * Tells a story that is far more intriguing than the myth * Oldie * Memories can be both &#34;treasures&#34; and &#34;consuming fires of torment&#34;, as Laura Ingalls Wilder knew. Caroline Fraser&#39;s rigorously researched biography shows how the author&#39;s life was so much more painful than it appears in her writings. Having combed through manuscripts, letters and other documents, Fraser has gained insight into the history that shaped her, including the dust bowl and the great depression. She explores the dreams that sustained the writer - and gets to the heart of a pioneer spirit. Here is an atmospheric portrait of places as much as of a person, too: the log cabin in which Wilder was born, the Great Plains, the dense forests and, of course, the prairies -- Anita Sethi * Observer * The sweep of the story is magnificent -- Laura Freeman * The Times * A fascinating tale, which spans an extraordinary period of American history . . . Whether you&#39;re a Wilder fan or have never picked up one of her books, this is compelling stuff - and as a history of the American dream, it&#39;s hard to beat * Telegraph * Fraser&#39;s gripping account is much more than a biography. Hugely recommended, even if you haven&#39;t read Wilder -- Claire Lowdon * Sunday Times, Books of the Year * [This new biography is] just as gripping as the original novels . . . As pacy and vivid as one of Wilder&#39;s own narratives, this surprising biography is immensely revealing both about Wilder and about America&#39;s founding myths -- Eleanor Mills * Sunday Times *</p><h2>Just William</h2><p>A facsmile of the first edition of this William book - the first of all the William books.</p><p></p><h2>The Kevin Show: An Olympic Athlete&#x2019;s Battle with Mental Illness</h2><p><p><b>From the <i>NYT </i>bestselling author of <i>The Monopolists</i>, the "fascinating" (<i>People</i>) story of Olympian Kevin Hall and the syndrome that makes him believe he stars in a television show of his life.</b></p><p>Meet Kevin Hall: brother, son, husband, father, and Olympic sailor. Kevin has an Ivy League degree, a winning smile, and throughout his adult life, he has been engaged in an ongoing battle with a person that doesn't exist to anyone but him: the Director. In the tradition of Kay Redfield Jamison's <i>An Unquiet Mind</i>, journalist and <i>NYT </i>bestselling author Mary Pilon's <i>The Kevin Show</i> reveals the many-sided struggle--of Kevin, his family, and the medical profession--to understand and treat a psychiatric disorder whose euphoric highs and creative ties to pop culture have become inextricable from Kevin's experience of himself.</p><p>Kevin suffers from what doctors are beginning to call the "Truman Show" delusion, a form of bipolar disorder named for the 1998 movie in which the main character realizes he is the star of a reality TV show. When the Director commands Kevin to do things, the results often lead to handcuffs, hospitalization, or both. Once he nearly drove a car into Boston Harbor. His girlfriend, now wife, was in the passenger seat.</p><p>Interweaving Kevin's perspective--including excerpts from his journals and sketches--with police reports, medical records, and interviews with those who were present at key moments in his life, <i>The Kevin Show</i> is a bracing, suspenseful, and eye-opening view of the role that mental health plays in a seemingly ordinary life.</p></p><p><p><b>Mary Pilon </b>is the author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Monopolists</i>, the acclaimed history of the board game Monopoly. A regular contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i>,<i> Esquire</i>,<i> Fast Company</i>, MSNBC,<i> Vice</i>, and <i>Politico</i>, Pilon has also worked as a staff reporter at the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>and was a producer for NBC Sports at the 2016 Olympics. She lives in Brooklyn. Visit her website at marypilon.com and follow her on Twitter at @marypilon.</p><p>"Absorbing and empathetic . . . Pilon is a paragon of dogged research. She&#x2019;s best in reconstructing (via hundreds of hours of interviews) the intertwined life struggles of Hall, his steadfast sweetheart and eventual wife, his vexed parents and some denizens of the competitive sailing world. Her attempts to reach Hall&#x2019;s &#x201c;inner world&#x201d; display levels of empathy that touch the heart." - <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"As [<i>The Kevin Show</i>] journeys through Hall's illness, it also forces readers to consider the 'sanity' of their own relationship to a media-saturated world . . . Grippingly provocative reading." - <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Pilon&#x2019;s compelling portrait of a remarkable young man and the challenges he faces as a cancer survivor, Olympic athlete, and bipolar patient underscores all the difficulties involved, especially in treating mental illness, and offers insights into the effects it has on patients and their families." - <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"A captivating narrative that details the many challenges Hall has faced as a result of his disorder . . . Sharp and compelling, this highly entertaining account will reframe the way you see mental health in everyday life." - <i>Bustle</i></p><p>"Kevin Hall battles a rare delusion. He often believes he's starring in his own reality show. Despite that, he's a husband, dad, and Olympic sailor. How does that work? Fascinating." - <i>People Magazine</i></p><p>"Draws attention to the toll of mental illness on individuals and their families." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"[A] nonfiction standout . . . With impressive detail and sensitivity, journalist Mary Pilon, captures the highs and lows of Kevin&#x2019;s life with mental illness." - <i>Best of the Year, Real Simple</i></p><p>"Pilon's empathetic approach and Hall's precise expression of his unique inner world make this an important biographical study for mental health collections, sports fans, and readers interested in the increasingly blurry line between fantasy and reality." - <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"Spellbinding. Brilliant. A true-life psychological thriller that captures the ongoing drama of a major mental illness as it unfolds while also recognizing its complexity and majesty." - <i>Edward M. Hallowell, M.D., bestselling author of DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION</i></p><p>"[A] fascinating history . . . <i>The Monopolists</i> lucidly weaves together a multifaceted story . . . [It] builds to an intense pitch--while highlighting several fundamental issues of capitalism." - <i>Los Angeles Times on THE MONOPOLISTS</i></p><p>"A legal, corporate and intellectual whodunit . . . The tale, like the game, becomes a parable for American capitalism, with powerful players stamping out competitors and fortunes being made or destroyed at the roll of the dice . . . anyone who grew up playing Monopoly will have a hard time resisting <i>The Monopolists</i>." - <i>Washington Post on THE MONOPOLISTS</i></p><p>"Highly entertaining . . . Like Monopoly itself, the book unfolds in interesting directions, probing into lost Quaker communities, the early history of Atlantic City, and how a game originally invented to critique capitalism became its most diverting simulacrum." - <i>The Boston Globe on THE MONOPOLISTS</i></p><p>"With more twists and turns than an Agatha Christie mystery, reporter Pilon reveals the tumultuous history of Monopoly . . . More entertaining than the game itself." - <i>Starred review, Publishers Weekly on THE MONOPOLISTS</i></p><p>"Briskly enlightening . . . [Pilon] has woven a plush, often humorous tapestry of board-game and social history." - <i>New York Times Book Review on THE MONOPOLISTS</i></p></p><h2>Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict, New and Revised Edition</h2><p>This acclaimed study surveys the dominant popular and scholarly images of the Israel&#x2013;Palestine conflict. Finkelstein opens with a theoretical discussion of Zionism, locating it as a romantic form of nationalism that assumed the bankruptcy of liberal democracy. He goes on to look at the demographic origins of the Palestinians, with particular reference to the work of Joan Peters, and develops critiques of the influential studies of both Benny Morris and Anita Shapira. Reviewing the diplomatic history with Aban Eban&#x2018;s oeuvre as his foil, Finkelstein closes by demonstrating that the casting of Israel as the innocent victim of Arab aggression in the June 1967 and October 1973 wars is not supported by the documentary record.<br><br> This new edition critically reexamines dominant popular and scholarly images in the light of the current failures of the peace process.</p><p><b>Norman G.

He has worked in the business world at IBM and in various management positions, and he taught high school for four years. Mark now speaks to thousands of people a year at conferences, camps, retreats, etc. He has also appeared on numerous radio and television shows. Mark&#39;s favorite thing to do is to go out and meet people and find out what they believe and why they believe it. You can find Mark at malls, concerts, art and music festivals, airports, beaches, sporting events, college campuses, etc., doing just that.&#34;The number-one reason people don&#39;t share their faith is that they are afraid of being rejected. Let&#39;s walk through some questions you can ask to learn about the person&#39;s spiritual beliefs. A conversation starter can be as simple as asking, &#39;Do you believe in Easter (or Christmas)? What do you believe about it?&#39; Another good way to transition to a spiritual topic is to say, &#39;Can I ask you an interesting question?&#39; Or, &#39;Can I ask you a tough question?&#39; This helps to pique curiosity and get people thinking before you even ask the main question. Then simply ask any of the following questions to help you learn their spiritual beliefs. &#39;Where are you on your spiritual journey?&#39; &#39;If you died tonight, are you 100-percent sure that you would go to Heaven?&#39; &#39;If you were to die tonight and stand in front of God, and He asked, &#34;Why should I let you into Heaven?&#34; what would you tell Him?&#39; &#39;When you die, what do you think is on the other side?&#39; &#39;Why do you wear that cross?&#39;&#34;</p><h2>The Furthest Station: A PC Grant Novella</h2><p>A brand new novella in the PC Grant series!

If a real, dumb newspaper wrote a feature story about hell, you bet its headline would be the boosterish one imagined by the maniacs at the Onion: "Tenth Circle Added to Rapidly Growing Hell." When one reads in this book the headline "Arabs, Israelis Sign 'Screw Peace' Accord," one wonders whether <i>The Onion</i> has not, alas, anticipated the news. Their style of yuks is not for softies: the headline "Loved Ones Recall Local Man's Cowardly Battle with Cancer" may not strike the funny bone of the recently bereaved, but it's a dead-on parody of the sort of sentimental slop that cops major journalism awards in our dumb news era.

But this is a life as it was actually lived, with romance, passion, and no little share of pain. Set in five different apartments in Manhattan, each one with its own character and charm, Cantwell&#39;s story winds through its phases, from single working girl to young wife and mother, from career choices and divorce to rediscovery. The world Cantwell inhabits - that of magazine and book publishing and fashion and the middle-class bohemia of downtown New York at a golden moment in time - is brought beautifully to life in a memoir that is sure to bring her new readers and renewed acclaim.</p><p><b>Mary Cantwell</b> is a former magazine editor and longtime member of the <b>New York Times</b> Editorial Board. She lives in New York City.Former writer and editor for <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Mademoiselle</i>, Cantwell locates her memories of work, friends, marriage, and motherhood in the places where she's dwelled. Five Manhattan apartments act as mental guide in retracing the footsteps of her past. From neurosis and near anorexia to the awe of her first Paris trip, Cantwell's memoir speaks intimately, honestly, and in a generous way that makes readers feel as though they were listening to a personal account retold only for them. Her earlier work, <i>American Girl: Scenes from a Small-Town Childhood</i> (1992), garnered attention and praise for the strength of its language, choice of details, and resonance of subject matter. This book, too, has all that plus Manhattan's eloquence in the 1950s and 1960s. Although this chronicle could easily succumb to politically correct revisions of the past or become a sentimental trip down memory lane, Cantwell avoids those pitfalls through sincerity--a true attempt to recall accurately and learn from her past. Somewhat literary, offering a little superficial fashion world "glam" and New York savvy, this book should appeal to many different kinds of readers. <i>Janet St. John</i></p><h2>Depth Psychology and a New Ethic (Torchbooks)</h2><p>The modern world has witnessed a dramatic breakthrough of the dark, negative forces of human nature. The "old ethic," which pursued an illusory perfection by repressing the dark side, has lost its power to deal with contemporary problems. Erich Neumann was convinced that the deadliest peril now confronting humanity lay in the "scapegoat" psychology associated with the old ethic. We are in the grip of this psychology when we project our own dark shadow onto an individual or group identified as our "enemy," failing to see it in ourselves. The only effective alternative to this dangerous shadow projection is shadow recognition, acknowledgement, and integration into the totality of the self. Wholeness, not perfection, is the goal of the new ethic.</p><p>Erich Neumann was a psychoanalyst who studied with C. G. Jung in Zurich. Trained in philosophy and medicine, he was also a poet and novelist. Dr. Neumann practiced analytical psychology in Tel Aviv from 1934 until his death in 1960.

In the winter of 1943-44, Anzio, a small Mediterranean resort and port some thirty-five miles south of Rome, played a crucial role in the fortunes of World War II as the target of an amphibious Allied landing. The Allies planned to bypass the strong German defenses along the Gustav Line and at Monte Cassino sixty miles to the southeast, which were holding up the American and British armies and preventing the liberation of Rome. By taking advantage of Allied command of the sea and air to effect complete surprise, infantry and armored forces landing at Anzio on January 22 were expected to secure the beachhead and then push inland to cut off the two main highways and railroads supplying the German forces to the south, either trapping and annihilating the German armies or forcing them to withdraw to the north, thus opening the way to Rome. </p> <p>But the reality of one of the most desperate campaigns of World War II was bad management, external meddling, poorly relayed orders, and uncertain leadership. The Anzio beachhead became a death trap, with Allied troops forced to fight for their lives for four dreadful months. The eventual victory in May 1944 was muted, bitter, and overshadowed by the Allied landings in Normandy on June 6. Mixing flawless research, drama, and combat with a brilliant narrative voice, <i>Fatal Decision</i> is one of the best histories ever written of a World War II military campaign. </p></p><p><p>Carlo D'Este, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and a distinguished military historian, is the author of the acclaimed biographies <em>Patton: A Genius for War</em> and <em>Eisenhower: A Soldier's Life</em>, among other books on World War II. He lives in Massachusetts.</p>A meticulous audit of Operation Shingle, the WW II campaign designed to win Rome for Allied forces at an acceptable cost. D'Este (Bitter Victory, Decision in Normandy) provides a panoramic overview of the planning, preparation, and execution of the 1944 assault on Anzio, a Mediterranean port about 30 miles south of Rome. The aim of the amphibious thrust was to bypass strong German defenses along the so-called Gustav line and at Monte Cassino, which had stalled American and well as British armies in their drive to liberate Rome. In D'Este's persuasive view, the strike failed in its objectives for lack of decisive leadership. For example, instead of issuing firm orders, General Sir Harold Alexander made gentlemanly instructions which Mark Clark (commander of the US Fifth Army) often ignored. Nor did Clark prod subordinates to seize highways and rail lines that supplied Wehrmacht forces under the able command of Field Marshal Albert Kesselring. At any rate, the Anzio beachhead became a death trap in which Allied troops fought for their lives in rain and mud for over five dreadful months. When opposition finally crumbled under air and sea pounding, Clark neglected to pursue, let alone destroy, retreating German soldiers, so great was his ambition to be the first man into Rome. In a crowning irony, the recapture of Italy's capital was almost wholly overshadowed by the D-day landings in France. In D'Este's book, blame for the botched Anzio expedition is widely shared. Among others meriting censure, he singles out a meddlesome Winston Churchill, who sowed confusion in the Allied ranks and raised unrealistic expectations. A vivid account of a campaign that attests to the high cost of miscalculation and overconfidence in matters military. (Sixteen pages of maps--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Bauer gives an overview of Jewish history beginning 2000 years B.C.E. and notes the many conflicts and discriminations the Jewish people have suffered throughout time. Placed within that context, the initial disbelief from many Jews regarding the plan of complete annihilation becomes much more understandable, although the author reports the cases of Jewish resistance and help from outside sources. Unfortunately, though, the end result is one with which we are all too familiar. The organization and exhaustive coverage are first-rate, and this revision of a 1982 title includes information not available earlier from both Eastern and Western countries. The "what" and "how" are included here, but there is also an attempt to discover the "why," and that is what lifts this title into the realm of an advanced study of a difficult topic.

Her throat had been slashed so badly that she was nearly decapitated. Her wounds revealed that she had been held upside down until her body had been emptied of blood. As this blood was not found at the crime scene, it must have been collected and carried away. For most of history, belief in Jewish ritual murder was acceptable and widely accepted. Naturally, the Jews aren&#39;t the only group who have practiced (and might still practice) ritual murder. Historically, it is fairly common: the Aztecs, numerous African tribes, and the ancient Carthagians come to mind. But since WW2, with the rise of Jewish ownership of the mass media, has come the politically-correct &#34;Doctrine of the Never-Guilty Jews.&#34; Every accusation of Jewish ritual murder, no matter how well proved it might have been in its time, has become a &#34;blood libel&#34; in today&#39;s media, a phrase that explicitly frames each case as a malicious falsehood, without an examination of the facts. Probably, not every accusation is true. But it is also unlikely that all of them are false. Philip de Vier has made a thorough survey of the known evidence in about 200 cases of ritual murder in ancient, medieval, renaissance and modern times. Adopting the approach of a detective investigating a murder, de Vier invites his readers to sift the relevant facts from history and to see that they point toward the existence of a transgenerational ritual murder cult within the larger body of Judaic tradition. The evidence is persuasive, but, says de Vier, the final verdict is ours to make. 256 pages ----- Soft Cover</p><p></p><h2>A Theology of the Holy Spirit; The Pentecostal Experience and the New Testament Witness</h2><p>Bruner has been both thorough and fair, and has written a book that combines scholarly research with constructive commentary on the life and mission of the contemporary Church.</p><p></p><h2>Unseasonable Truths: The Life of Robert Maynard Hutchins</h2><p>A personal and engaging account of the life of the renowned and controversial educator, who, as president of the University of Chicago, remolded the undergraduate curriculum and attracted many of the country&#39;s leading scholars</p><p>By the age of 28, Hutchins was dean of Yale Law School; at 30, he was president of the University of Chicago; and by his death at 78 in 1977, he was world renowned for his efforts to improve American education. This first full-length biography by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ashmore is stron gest in describing the political and philosophical struggles behind Hutchins's controversial Chicago presidency, his McCarthy-era civil rights efforts with the Fund for the Republic and his work at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, where Ashmore served as president. But although the biographer provides an important introduction to the work of an original thinker, his genteel prose often barely masks an old-fashioned sexism; for example, the complex personal life of a public innovator surely deserves a more detached, probing look than Ashmore's assessment of Hutchins's marriage: "It was perhaps inevitable that when the bemusement of youthful attraction dissipated, a man committed to ideas would find it impossible to continue to live under the same roof with a woman whose responses were primarily sensory."

No markings - extremely light wear. Publisher priced dust jacket - no remainder marks.</p><p>This history and guide to the workings and wares of "the largest wholesale fish market in the Western hemisphere" evokes the vitality of a marketplace with roots as old as New York City itself ("the pace is brisk, the atmosphere is macho"). The market serves as a microcosm of the culinary and cultural diversity of New York, as Beck's ( Produce: A Fruit and Vegetable Lovers' Guide ) collection of over 150 recipes, gathered from local homes and restaurants, celebrates an abundance of seafood. Descriptions of the fish sold at market (arranged alphabetically, by scientific rather than common name) include information on place of origin and seasonal availability, comparable quality of varieties and substitutions that will aid the fish purchaser. Equally useful are instructions on filleting and cleaning fish and advice on seafood safety (properly cooking or freezing fish will kill all potentially dangerous parasites). Recipes are organized by cooking technique--broiling, baking, frying--and feature ethnically inspired specialties, classic and New American dishes, haute and nouvelle French cuisines and basic recipes (baked whole fish).

On the other hand, Los Angeles chefs/restaurateurs Peel and Silverton draw upon both their professional know-how and the experience of raising three children to attempt to create appealing kid- and adult-satisfying dishes. Along the way, they update many American food classics. A BLT sandwich, for example, becomes a 1990s lunch treat with smoky bacon, Boston lettuce, and sun-dried tomatoes on toasted sourdough bread with a dollop of pepper mayonnaise. Baked fusilli and aged gouda now substitute for that old standby, macaroni and cheese. And a quarter-pound of red potatoes turns cake brownies into a densely rich dessert. Most of the 190+ recipes do require some kitchen competence and a well-stocked pantry; however, the authors streamline many of the cooking steps and supply tips about techniques and ingredients. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i>Silverton and Peel are the chef/owners of Los Angeles's Campanile restaurant and La Brea Bakery; Silverton, an acclaimed pastry chef, is also author of Desserts ( LJ 11/15/86). They are the parents of two young children, and here they present a collection of the dishes they like to cook when they're not at the restaurant and bakery. Although some of the recipes may seem easier to those with professional backgrounds than to the average home cook, there are lots of relatively simple dishes here, and lots of attention is paid to what kids really eat.

Its overture was played out in the trenches of the Great War; its coda on a ruined continent. It opened with conventional declarations of war and finished with &#x201c;unconditional surrender.&#x201d; Proclamations of national unity led to eventual devastation, with entire countries torn to pieces. During these three decades of deepening conflicts, a classical interstate conflict morphed into a global civil war, abandoning rules of engagement and fought by irreducible enemies rather than legitimate adversaries, each seeking the annihilation of its opponents. It was a time of both unchained passions and industrial, rationalized massacre. Utilizing multiple sources, Enzo Traverso depicts the dialectic of this era of wars, revolutions and genocides. Rejecting commonplace notions of &#x201c;totalitarian evil,&#x201d; he rediscovers the feelings and reinterprets the ideas of an age of intellectual and political commitment when Europe shaped world history with its own collapse.</p><p><b>Enzo Traverso</b> taught political science for almost twenty years in France.

It was only after three valiant but unsuccessful attempts that Leonie was finally accepted by the Visitation Order in Caen.

In her first solo effort, Wright-Frierson (illustrator of Sheila Cole's When the Tide Is Low, 1985, among others) organizes her book as a series of dawn-to-dusk, sketchbook impressions made during many trips to the desert for observation and watercolor painting. The vivid text takes the form of involving first-person journal entries that accompany accurate, beautiful watercolors of the desert (in one, she includes her own hands sketching in a notebook as part of the illustration). Roadrunners, tortoises, jackrabbits, snakes, elf owls, and woodpeckers are just a few of the animals observed and documented in their habitat, while Saguaro cactus, creosote, acacia, prickly pear, and mesquite fill each page. There is much to enjoy, but the first lessons to absorb are on becoming careful, consistent investigators of nature. Exemplary science writing.

Wright-Frierson invites readers to spend a day in her company, savoring the Sonoran Desert of the American Southwest. She presents a dawn to dusk panorama in a profusion of watercolor sketches and a brief, conversational text. While calling to mind Jennifer Dewey's Night and Day in the Desert (Little, 1991) or Joyce Powzyk's Wallaby Creek (Lothrop, 1985), this artist's sketchbook is intensely personal. Her goal is not scientific depth, though the snippets of information may well entice the intellectually curious to conduct further investigations. Rather, her "scrapbook" serves to give a rich impression of a unique ecological environment: a feel for a landscape of compelling extremes and the creatures who have adapted to meet its unforgiving demands.

When the time comes for his sons to marry, their father instructs them to string their bows and shoot arrows "as far as you can into the heart of Russia. Whoever finds your arrow shall be your bride." While the two elder sons find perfectly conventional wives, the arrow of the youngest, Prince Ivan, is found in the mouth of a small green frog. Despite his dismay with his fate, he does marry her and discovers that she is really quite talented. She is, in fact, the renowned and beautiful Vasilisa the Wise, who has been placed under enchantment by her jealous father. In classic fairy-tale fashion, Ivan foolishly burns his wife's frog skin, thereby banishing her to the land of the evil Koshchei the Invincible. In his quest to rescue Vasilisa, he encounters Baba Yaga who, in this story, actually lends a helping hand, and a series of animals who prove to be the key to solving the riddle that will save his bride. Lewis's retelling of this complex Russian tale is smooth and easy, lightened by touches of humor, and with only a minor lapse in continuity marring the narrative flow. Spirin creates an appropriately misty and romantic world, so well suited to a classic tale. His watercolors are rich in color and detail, picturing the sumptuous interiors and snowy landscapes. A fine addition to any folklore collection.<br><i>Linda Boyles, Alachua County Library District, Gainesville, FL</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Spirin's ( The Children of Lir ) sumptuous art is reason alone to celebrate this volume, but the text is every bit as rich. Working from a Russian folktale, Lewis ( A Hippopotomusn't ) fashions a complex story out of a multitude of fairy-tale elements. A czar commands each of his three sons to shoot an arrow into the woods and marry the woman who retrieves it; while the elder brothers find important, wealthy maidens, Ivan, the youngest, is forced to marry a small frog. But Ivan's bride soon reveals herself to be Vasilisa the Wise, under a curse from her evil father. Determined to keep her in human form, Ivan burns her frog skin. As a result she is transformed into a swan and flies off to a Kingdom beyond Blue Kingdoms, from which Ivan must rescue her. Her perilous journey, during which she is aided by such unlikely creatures as a bear, a falcon, a pike and the infamous Baba Yaga, forms the second half of the narrative. Lewis, admirably, summons enough flair to link the numerous motifs. Spirin's minutely detailed portraits adorn each page, highlighting every flounce, every furbelow of the characters' court clothing; and he frames boxes of text with full-bleed paintings that resemble embroidered and bejeweled fabrics. That Spirin can use four-color art to create the effect of lustrous gold ink is further proof that he has the talents of an alchemist.

It is also one of history&#x2019;s most mysterious and compelling works of art. This haunting stitched account of the battle that redrew the map of medieval Europe has inspired dreams of theft, waves of nationalism, visions of limitless power, and esthetic rapture. In his fascinating new book, Yale professor R. Howard Bloch reveals the history, the hidden meaning, the deep beauty, and the enduring allure of this astonishing piece of cloth.<br><br>Bloch opens with a gripping account of the event that inspired the Tapestry: the swift, bloody Battle of Hastings, in which the Norman bastard William defeated the Anglo-Saxon king, Harold, and laid claim to England under his new title, William the Conqueror. But to truly understand the connection between battle and embroidery, one must retrace the web of international intrigue and scandal that climaxed at Hastings. Bloch demonstrates how, with astonishing intimacy and immediacy, the artisans who fashioned this work of textile art brought to life a moment that changed the course of British culture and history. <br><br>Every age has cherished the Tapestry for different reasons and read new meaning into its enigmatic words and images. French nationalists in the mid-nineteenth century, fired by Tapestry&#x2019;s evocation of military glory, unearthed the lost French epic &#x201c;The Song of Roland,&#x201d; which Norman troops sang as they marched to victory in 1066. As the Nazis tightened their grip on Europe, Hitler <br>sent a team to France to study the Tapestry, decode its Nordic elements, and, at the end of the war, with Paris under siege, bring the precious cloth to Berlin. The richest horde of buried Anglo-Saxon treasure, the matchless beauty of Byzantine silk, Aesop&#x2019;s strange fable &#x201c;The Swallow and the Linseed,&#x201d; the colony that Anglo-Saxon nobles founded in the Middle East following their defeat at Hastings&#x2013;all are brilliantly woven into Bloch&#x2019;s riveting narrative.<br><br>Seamlessly integrating Norman, Anglo-Saxon, Viking, and Byzantine elements, the Bayeux Tapestry ranks with Chartres and the Tower of London as a crowning achievement of medieval Europe. And yet, more than a work of art, the Tapestry served as the suture that bound up the wounds of 1066. <br><br>Enhanced by a stunning full-color insert that includes reproductions of the complete Tapestry, <i>A Needle in the Right Hand of God </i>will stand with <i>The Professor and the Madman</i> and <i>How the Irish Saved Civilization</i> as a triumph of popular history.</p><p>Director of the Humanities Division and Sterling Professor of French at Yale, R.

In the two weeks since his spectacular crossing of the Channel in a thousand boats, he had pillaged freely in the English countryside between the old Roman ports of Pevensey and Hastings. Now word came that King Harold had defeated Scandinavian invaders near the town of York and was advancing rapidly from the North. By nightfall, Anglo-Saxons appeared along Senlac ridge, the high ground above the Norman camp. Harold held a strategic advantage over William, who was on unfamiliar terrain. He would be even stronger if reinforcements arrived from London.<br><br> William ordered his troops on high alert. Many did not sleep at all that night. Others awoke with the first light, which appeared at 5:20 on the morning of October 14. Sunrise at 6:28 brought an ominous sign. As William dressed for battle surrounded by his most trusted advisers&#x2014;his half-brothers, Bishop Odo of Bayeux and Count Robert of Mortain, and a company of great Norman and Breton lords&#x2014;his squires put on his corselet the wrong way around. It was a small thing, but William had confessed his sins the night before and made Communion at the first hour. In a world that believed in dialogue between the human and the divine, it seemed a sign from God. As his attendants struggled to turn the padding beneath his finely woven chain mail and breast armor, William made light of the situation. &#x201c;We shall turn the strength of my duchy,&#x201d; he joked, &#x201c;into a kingdom.&#x201d; He lifted the little sack of relics from Odo&#x2019;s extended hand and placed them around his neck, and before Odo had finished praying for victory, William ordered the battle ranks. The duke was steady in the face of unpredictable events. In the crossing of the Channel on the night of September 27, William&#x2019;s ship had arrived before the rest of the fleet. An oarsman reported that &#x201c;as far as he could see there was nothing but sea and sky.&#x201d; The Norman leader, certain that &#x201c;all the others would arrive before long,&#x201d; sat down to &#x201c;an abundant meal, accompanied by spiced wine, as if we were in his hall at home.&#x201d;<br><br> The French from France would be on the left, the Bretons on the right, William and the Normans in the center. The archers on foot would open the battle. Set crossbowmen would &#x201c;pierce the faces of the English with their speeding shafts.&#x201d; The knights on horse would be to the rear of the foot. William pronounced what he knew might be his final words: &#x201c;Raise your standards, men, and let there be no measure or moderation to your righteous anger. Let the lightning of your glory be seen from the east to the west, let the thunder of your charge be heard, and may you be the avengers of most noble blood.&#x201d;<br><br> Great shouting could be heard, the clinking of lifted helmets and mail, the clatter of horses&#x2019; hooves, and the harsh bray of trumpets on both sides. Dragons could be seen everywhere, on shields and on the banners that caught the wind, as William&#x2019;s army began to array itself as he had ordered. The horsemen and infantry followed the banners to join their battalion; the archers observed them to know by the angle of their flutter how high and in what direction to shoot. The English could not be far off. Through the dust rising from the Norman camp, the forest glittered, full of spears.<br><br> Suddenly, one of William&#x2019;s men rode out before the rest. He was not a knight, but a poet by the name of Taillefer, one of the jongleurs the duke had brought with him to entertain the troops. He tossed his sword in the air and began to twirl it in front of the enemy line. Heedless of death, he pricked his horse, which began to charge. He lowered his lance, which pierced an Anglo-Saxon shield, knocking the ax bearer lifeless to the ground. The jongleur severed the head from the prostrate body and, holding it in the air for the Normans to see, began to sing. &#x201c;The Norman army,&#x201d; in the words of a later chronicler, &#x201c;struck up the song of Roland to fire them into battle with the example of a heroic warrior.&#x201d; As Taillefer fell, the missiles of war began to fly overhead&#x2014;arrows, javelins, axes, stones tied to sticks, the square bolts from the crossbows that no shield could resist.<br><br> The fighting did not at first go as William planned. The suddenness of the attack left no time for those on foot to place themselves in advance of the mounted knights. Norman archers could not soften Harold&#x2019;s ax-bearing housecarls, the king&#x2019;s personal guard. The knights with lances couched under their arms failed to penetrate the Anglo-Saxon shield wall. In the chaos of the first clash, the rumor circulated that William had been killed. His men broke rank. William quickly decided that he must turn the situation as he had turned his corselet earlier that morning. Drawing upon a tactic that had worked in the past and was well known to the knights who had traveled all the way from southern Italy for the campaign against Harold, the Norman chief joined his fleeing troops until he seemed to be leading the rout. Then, wheeling in his tracks, William raised his visor and showed his face. &#x201c;Look at me,&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;I am alive, and with the aid of God I will conquer. What madness is persuading you to flee? What way is open to escape? The sea lies behind. You will fight to conquer, if you want only to live!&#x201d; Odo, armed with a club to respect the Christian prohibition against ecclesiastics shedding blood, &#x201c;rallied the young men.&#x201d;<br><br> The Anglo-Saxons rejoiced to see the Normans flee, and, as William had gambled that he would, Harold charged. The Normans drew the enemy from the high ground. Fanning out and doubling back, they caught the Anglo-Saxon army in a pincer maneuver like that by which Allied forces would trap the German Seventh Army in the Falaise Pocket in August 1944. And the fighting, as in the Battle of Normandy of World War II, was close and fierce. &#x201c;The dead by falling seemed to move more than the living,&#x201d; recalled one eyewitness. &#x201c;It was not possible for the lightly wounded to escape, for they were crushed to death by the serried ranks of their companions.&#x201d; William lost three mounts, killed from under him as he fought on horseback and hand-to-hand among his troops. &#x201c;With his angry blade he tirelessly pierced shields, helmets, and hauberks,&#x201d; writes William&#x2019;s chaplain and biographer, William of Poitiers. &#x201c;Utterly disdaining fear and dishonor, the Duke charged his enemies and laid them low.&#x201d;<br><br> The sun set at 5:04 on October 14, 1066, and at the end of the day, six thousand human corpses, half of those who had ridden, sailed, or walked to Hastings, littered the field alongside six hundred horses. &#x201c;The mangled bodies that had been the flower of the English nobility and youth covered the ground as far as the eye could see,&#x201d; laments the twelfth-century historian Orderic Vitalis. Harold was dead, so mutilated that his wife was brought to identify his body by &#x201c;certain marks.&#x201d; Anglo-Saxons who survived their leader made a last stand along a trench known in the eleventh century as the malfosse, &#x201c;bad ditch,&#x201d; into which many Normans, not knowing the terrain, fell and perished without realizing they had won the day. &#x201c;Many left their corpses in deep woods, many who had collapsed on the routes blocked the way for those who came after. Even the hooves of the horses inflicted punishment on the dead.&#x201d; As the last of Harold&#x2019;s followers vanished into the night, William&#x2019;s army, exhausted, made camp among the fallen of both sides over which he now ruled as king. Having awakened that morning still burdened by the title by which he had always been known, &#x201c;the Bastard,&#x201d; Duke William went to sleep that night having earned the name history would accord him&#x2014;&#x201c;the Conqueror.&#x201d;<br><br> The meeting of Normans and Anglo-Saxons at Hastings was the most decisive battle of the Middle Ages and one of the determining days in the making of the West. Hastings changed Britain, which had been dominated since the end of Roman rule by invading tribes from the Continent and the North&#x2014;Angles, Saxons, and Vikings. This day more than any other turned Britain away from its Scandinavian past and toward Europe. Hastings inaugurated the era of the knight, the social dominance of those who fought with lance on horseback. With the watershed of 1066 came the beginning of the end of the chaos and darkness&#x2014;the political disintegration and the lack of learning&#x2014; between the collapse of Charlemagne&#x2019;s empire after his death in the early ninth century and the flowering of state institutions and culture of the Anglo-Norman world. How fitting that the Norman army should enter battle singing of the heroic deeds of Charlemagne&#x2019;s nephew Roland, as if William would begin where the emperor of the Franks had left off. William had himself crowned king of England on Christmas day 1066, just as Charlemagne had been crowned in Rome on Christmas day 800.<br><br> If the Battle of Hastings began with poetry, it ended in the realm of the visual arts. The Norman Conquest of England produced the world&#x2019;s most famous textile, the Bayeux Tapestry, a 230-foot-long-by-20-inch- high running embroidered account of the events leading to Hastings and of the battle itself. Made in the decades following the Conquest by those who were party to it, the Tapestry, which contains both images and Latin inscriptions, is a principal source of kno...</p><h2>Hiking Waterfalls in North Carolina: A Guide to the State&#39;s Best Waterfall Hikes</h2><p>A beautiful, full-color guidebook to more than 150 of the best waterfall hikes in North Carolina.</p><p><p><i>Hiking Waterfalls in North Carolina</i> features hikes to more than 151 of the best waterfalls in the state, from the Blue Ridge Parkway to the Great Smoky Mountains.

On cue, the ring bearer steps forward to present the golden band. The groom reaches over, takes the ring with one hand, holds the left hand of his bride with the other, and ever so gently slips the eternal circle over her delicate third finger. It is easy to understand why people wear wedding rings. Besides being a reminder of one's vows, and a symbol of one's love, the presence of the wedding band also tells others a man or a woman is spoken for. But why is the ring worn on the left hand? And why the third finger? <p>If you research the matter, you will discover the custom goes back to the Romans. They believed a small artery, called vena amoris, or the "vein of love," ran from the third finger to the heart. It was felt wearing a ring on this finger joined the hearts of the couple in their destiny. The left hand was selected because it was closer to the heart. </p> <p>Cultural habits don't just come out of nowhere. Even if the people who practice them have forgotten why they do it, you can be sure their customs had a starting point in history. Although cultural habits often change over time, they do have original roots. For those of us who live in what is know as the "Western" world, our cultural roots go back primarily to two historic starting points: the ancient Greeks and the ancient Hebrews. This is not to say we couldn't go back further. But for the purposes of this discussion, we will focus primarily on the Hebrews and the Greeks because they have so strongly impacted our Western ways of thinking, right up to the present hour.</p></p><h2>Player's Option: Combat &amp; Tactics (Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Rulebook/2149)</h2><p>All the optional combat rules any gamer could want--in one volume!

For Isabel, the watershed was always eleven-thirty; that was the point at which if nothing was achieved, then nothing would be, the point at which one had to think about lunch, now just an hour away. <br>&nbsp;<br>Since Charlie had started going to his playgroup, the morn�ings had become even shorter, as he had to be fetched shortly after noon, and it took ten minutes to get him back and another ten minutes to get him changed out of his morning clothes; by this time, he would be covered in finger paint, crumbs, pieces of a curious modelling substance much approved of by the play�group authorities, grains of sand from the sandpit and, very occasionally, what looked like specks of blood. Boys, it seemed to Isabel, were magnets for dirt and detritus, and the only solu�tion, if one were wanted, was frequent changes of clothing. Or one could throw up one&#x2019;s hands and allow them to get dirtier through the day and then hose them down&#x2014;metaphorically, of course&#x2014;in the early evening. <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel opted to change Charlie, and so his morning clothes, once abandoned, were replaced with afternoon clothes. She decided that she rather liked the idea of having afternoon clothes, even if one were not a two-year-old. Changing into one&#x2019;s afternoon clothes could become something of a ritual, rather like changing for dinner&#x2014;which so few people did any more. And the afternoon clothes themselves could be the sub�ject of deliberation and chosen with care; they would be more loose-fitting than one&#x2019;s morning clothes, more autumnal in shade, perhaps&#x2014;clothes that would reflect the lengthening of shadows and sit well with the subtle change in light that comes after three; russet clothes, comfortable linen, loose-fitting col�lars and sleeves. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You thinking?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>It was Isabel&#x2019;s housekeeper, Grace. She had worked in the house when Isabel&#x2019;s father was still alive, and had been kept on by Isabel. It would have been impossible to ask Grace to leave&#x2014;even if Isabel had wanted to do so; she came with the house and had naturally assumed that the house could not be run without her. Isabel had felt vaguely apologetic about having a housekeeper&#x2014;it seemed such an extravagant, <i>privileged </i>thing to do, but a discussion with her friend, Peter Stevenson, had helped. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What good would it do if you were to stop that particular item of expenditure?&#x201d; Peter said. &#x201c;All it would mean was that Grace would be out of a job. What would it achieve?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But I feel embarrassed,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;Somebody of my age doesn&#x2019;t need a housekeeper. People will think I&#x2019;m lazy.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Peter was too perceptive to swallow that. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not it, is it? What&#x2019;s worrying you is that people will think that you&#x2019;re well-off, which you are. So why not just accept it? You use your money generously&#x2014;I know that. Carry on like that and forget what you imagine people think about you. It&#x2019;s not an actual <i>sin </i>to have money. The sin exists in using it selfishly, which you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; said Isabel. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Now Grace stood in the doorway of Isabel&#x2019;s workroom, a bucket in hand, on her way to performing the daily chore of washing down the Victorian encaustic-tile floor in the entrance hall. Isabel was not sure that this floor had to be washed every day, but Grace had always done it and would have resisted any suggestion that she change her routine. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now Grace&#x2019;s question hung in the air. She often asked Isabel whether she was thinking; it was almost an accusation. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I suppose I am thinking. But not about work, I must admit.&#x201d; Isabel, who was seated at her desk, gave a despairing glance at the piles of paper before her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid that I&#x2019;ve accomplished very little this morning.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; said Grace. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done none of the ironing yet, I&#x2019;m afraid. All those shirts of Jamie&#x2019;s.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Leave them,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;Jamie can iron them himself. It&#x2019;s very therapeutic for men to iron. Therapeutic for women, that is.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Grace shook her head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do them later this afternoon.&#x201d; She put down the bucket. &#x201c;Where does the time go? Do you ever ask yourself that?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Constantly,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;As most people do.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;Mind you, how much of our time, do you think, is spent asking ourselves where the time goes?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel remembered that it was a Friday, which meant that Grace would have spent the previous evening at one of her spiritualist meetings. She enjoyed hearing about these, as Grace was always prepared to give a candid assessment of the visiting medium. The previous week the visiting medium had been from Glasgow and had made contact with spirits who voiced an inter�esting, if somewhat unusual, complaint. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He said that there were a number of spirits trying to get through. He said that that they were all from Glasgow.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel had raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Do spirits live in particular places? I thought that the whole point about being disembodied is that you rose above constraints of place. Have I got it wrong?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Grace shook her head. &#x201c;Spirits often hang about the places that were special to them before they crossed over,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He said that these spirits wanted to get back to Glasgow because they weren&#x2019;t happy in Edinburgh.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A likely story!&#x201d; snorted Isabel. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;My feelings too,&#x201d; Grace had replied. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now, Isabel asked about the previous evening. Was the medium any good, or at least better than the man who con�tacted the unhappy Glaswegian spirits? <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Much better,&#x201d; said Grace. &#x201c;He was one of our regulars. We had him about four months ago and he was really good. He saw somebody&#x2019;s husband&#x2014;clear as day, he said. I was sitting next to the woman and I comforted her. It was very moving.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel said nothing. The fundamental premises of Grace&#x2019;s spiritualist meetings might not have withstood rigorous, rational examination, but there was little doubt in her mind about the solace that they gave. And what was wrong with anything that gave comfort to lives bereft of it? <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Grace continued. &#x201c;This medium&#x2014;he&#x2019;s called Mr. Barr; I don&#x2019;t know his first name, I&#x2019;m afraid&#x2014;he works in a bank. In the back room, I think; he&#x2019;s not a teller or anything like that. Anyway, he has a real talent for getting through to the other side. You can see it in his eyes; he just has that look to him&#x2014;you know what I mean?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel did. &#x201c;The light&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; said Grace. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the light that shines from the eyes. There&#x2019;s no mistaking it and he had it. It was like .&nbsp; . .&#x201d; She searched for an analogy, and then decided, &#x201c;Like a lighthouse.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel struggled with the image. Lighthouse eyes would pre�sumably send forth beams at intervals, which would create a rather odd impression, she felt, especially at night, and if such people lived by the sea . . . <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He said something very interesting,&#x201d; Grace continued. &#x201c;He said that he was getting a strong message from somebody who had been a stockbroker in Edinburgh in his lifetime. He was now on the other shore and wanted us to know that everything would be all right.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s reassuring,&#x201d; said Isabel. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I think he was talking about the country&#x2019;s economy. He said that we shouldn&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;it was going to be all right.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;I wonder how he knows?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Grace assumed a rather superior expression. &#x201c;They know,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We may not understand how they know, but the important thing is that they know. It&#x2019;s to do with time. Time has a different meaning in the spirit world.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel did not contradict this; she knew there was little point. If asked to justify her claims about the world beyond, Grace tended to shelter behind the idea that there were some forms of knowledge that somebody like Isabel simply could not grasp. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Skepticism closes the mind,&#x201d; she would say. &#x201c;Like a trap.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Grace continued with her report. &#x201c;He became quite specific, you know. He mentioned a particular company that he said would do well. He said that all the conditions were right for this to happen.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel expressed her surprise. &#x201c;A tip? An investment tip?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Grace. &#x201c;It was not like that at all. The spirit was just sharing something with us. He was obviously happy that this company would do well and he wanted us to share his happiness.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel hesitated for a moment. Grace&#x2019;s meeting must have been rich in comic possibilities, with the medium issuing what amounted to a stock-market prediction, and some of those attending, perhaps, discreetly writing down the details. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What company?&#x201d; she asked on impulse. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;West of Scotland Turbines,&#x201d; said Grace. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see their shares in the paper. Look at the stock-market page.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So they exist?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, of course they exist. I looked them up. They make tur�bines for hydroelectric schemes.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Grace appeared to feel that they had spent long enough on turbines and went on to say something about needing new scouring liquid for the upstairs shower, which was becoming mildewed. She looked at Isabel slightly reproachfully, as if she were responsible for the mildew. Isabel thought: It&#x2019;s not my fault, but Grace will always blame me. <br>&nbsp;<br>Then Grace said, &#x201c;Oh, somebody phoned while you were out. I asked for her name, but she just left a number for you to call back. It&#x2019;s in the basket. Some people don&#x2019;t give their names, which is odd, I think. It&#x2019;s as if they&#x2019;ve got something to hide .&nbsp; . .&#x201d; She examined Isabel as if she were conniving in, or at least con�doning, a whole series of anonymous calls. Then she continued, &#x201c;She sounded Australian.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>It was the woman whom Cat had met. Isabel glanced at her watch: there was time to return the call before she went off to collect Charlie. That would mean, of course, that she would have done no work at all that morning, and would probably do very little that afternoon. Did it matter? Would the world be changed if the next edition of the <i>Review of Applied Ethics </i>did not come out on time? The answer, of course, was that it would make very little difference&#x2014;a humbling thought. <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel rose from her desk and made her way into the kitchen. If Grace wanted to leave her a note, there was a small basket on top of the fridge in which notes were placed. There was one now, with a number scribbled on it in pencil. Under�neath the number, Grace had written: <i>woman</i>. Isabel smiled; she was reminded of her father, who had once said to her, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t write&#x2014;or say&#x2014;any more than you have to. Just don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Or think, perhaps? <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel took the note back to her study. There she wrote on it <i>West of Scotland Turbines</i>, and then picked up the telephone.</p></p><h2>Food As Medicine: How to Use Diet, Vitamins, Juices, and Herbs for a Healthier, Happier, and Longer Life</h2><p><p> Food is the original medicine. Food is the best medicine. </p><p> From Dr. Dharma Singh Khalsa, acclaimed author of the national bestseller Meditation as Medicine, comes <i>Food as Medicine</i> -- a remarkable book that balances both of Dr. Khalsa's specialties by advising readers on how to achieve maximum health from simply eating responsibly and well. </p><p> Grounded in medical science, Food as Medicine is a pragmatic and accessible reference for anyone seeking guidance on healthy eating or simple food remedies. Dr. Khalsa begins by setting readers on the right nutritional path -- regardless of their current eating habits -- and explains how to go organic, how to use natural organic juices and foods as medicine, and how special-food diets can help reverse the progress or diminish the symptoms of certain diseases, such as Alzheimer's or Hepatitis C. </p><p> The book is filled with interesting food facts: Blueberries can increase brain longevity through their ability to help release dopamine in the brain. Kiwi fruit, because of its high levels of disease-fighting antioxidants and phytonutrients, is said to be an excellent source in battling cancer and heart disease. Pears, with their high content of certain minerals and fibers, can help prevent fibroid tumors. </p><p> Drawing on Dr. Khalsa's own life experience as well as patient case histories, Food as Medicine outlines the seven principles of "The Khalsa Plan," details information on his other nutritional plans designed to target specific ailments, and lays out dozens of delicious, time-tested recipes that promote overall health and well-being.</p></p><p><b>Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D.,</b> a leading voice in the field of integrative medicine, is board-certified in anesthesiology, pain management, and anti-aging medicine. President and medical director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Foundation in Tucson, he lectures and consults worldwide. He is the author of <i>Meditation as Medicine, The Pain Cure,</i> and <i>Brain Longevity.</i> <p> <i>Food as Medicine</i> was chosen as a main selection of the One Spirit Book Club.</p><p><b>Chapter One: Spiritual Nutrition</b><br> </p><p> What a beautiful day for an epiphany. Here I am on a seventeen-mile mountain bike ride at an altitude of 6,700 feet in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The air I'm breathing in this pristine environment is clear and cool. It's a fresh, warm, early summer afternoon, and along with some new friends I am relishing a bit of free time at one of the most enlightening medical conferences I've ever attended. The event is devoted to using food to prevent and heal illness, and I feel so inspired that I can't wait to get back to Tucson to begin writing. I want very much to share all this new and exciting information with you, such as<br> </p><p> </p><li>how cancer can be prevented and reversed using food. </li><li>how heart disease can be treated using specific foods and nutrients. </li><li>how Alzheimer's disease can be prevented and treated with food and nutrients. </li><li>how food can cure chronic fatigue. </li><li>how diet and vitamins can restore emotional energy. <p><br> It turns out that every major ailment has a specific natural food prescription that can reverse its course. This is the cutting edge of medicine. </p><p> The Buddha wrote:<br> </p><p> Don't chase after the past,<br> Don't seek the future.<br> The past is gone.<br> The future hasn't come yet.<br> See clearly on the spot<br> That object which is now.<br> </p><p> In my work as a physician specializing in integrative medicine, I have used nutrition as part of my practice for many years. This type of medicine, as you may know, is the emerging field that blends the best of conventional Western science with ancient healing therapies such as yoga, meditation, nutrition, herbal medicines, and acupuncture. Because I use both Eastern and Western medicine, many of my patients have made unexpected recoveries from illnesses they had been struggling with for many years. Some of them have considered their recoveries to be miraculous, but I see only the natural outcome of good science and good sense. The one thing I have come to believe while participating in these recoveries with my patients -- whom I call my healing partners -- is that your body has the ability to heal itself if you just give it a chance. Using food as medicine gives my patients the greatest chance of all to heal. </p><p> One of the chief reasons my program has been so successful is that it treats each person as a unique being. If you come to see me, I take into consideration your biochemical uniqueness and then design a program to restore you to maximum physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. When that happens -- when you once again attain a healing balance in your body, mind, and spirit -- it certainly feels miraculous. It is the answer to your deepest prayer. </p><p> The practical use of modern nutritional principles, which I will present in this book, will allow you to activate your own natural inner healing force and bring you back into a balanced state. Since no two patients are alike, no two require exactly the same therapy. When a patient comes to me for pain, fatigue, memory loss, cancer recovery, high blood pressure, or some other ailment, I always have my nutritionist, Luz-Elena Shearer, R.D., M.S., meet with us. Working together, my patient, the patient's family, Luz, and I construct a perfect dietary prescription based on patient needs and preferences. Only rarely do two patients receive the same diet. I will present the information in this book so that you will be able to create a unique healing experience for yourself. </p><p> What I learned at the conference in Wyoming brought my knowledge and ability to help heal to a higher level. I learned the latest information on preventing and healing illness at the cellular level by using food to maintain genetic integrity. If you have been following the news about the human genome project, you are probably aware of the great advances it promises. One day, drugs or therapies will fight illness by treating our genes. But I believe we can do that right now by using food as our form of genetic therapy. My program will act on your body, your brain, your mind, and your spirit. It will also touch you on your deepest inner level: your soul. After all, mind, body, and spirit are united; they are one. True healing requires we affect them all. This is the future of medicine -- and here we are together at this precious moment.<br> </p><p> <b>SPIRITUAL NUTRITION</b> </p><p> Perhaps you are one of the many people today who are aware of the deep spiritual awakening occurring on the planet. You can see it in the latest best-selling books and seminars. Some of the most popular speakers of our day, such as my colleagues Dr. Deepak Chopra and Debbie Ford, bring a spiritual slant to everything they say and do. Take a look at Oprah Winfrey's show, the most popular program on daytime television, which has showcased many influential new authors and spokespersons for the benefits of a spiritual lifestyle. Each Oprah program ends with a segment called "Touching Spirit," which is very popular and empowering to the members of her audience. It stirs them at a deep level. </p><p> This kind of elevation in consciousness recently touched one of my healing partners, a forty-year-old woman named Jane, who had spent a lot of time searching for help in dealing with her serious case of chronic fatigue syndrome. Jane had visited some of the most highly regarded physicians in America but had made little progress. One renowned doctor saw her for fifteen minutes, glanced at her chart in a cursory way, and told her that he wasn't optimistic about her recovery. Despite that unpleasant experience, she kept searching for a cure -- or at least someone who believed in her ability to heal. Finally, she was referred to me. Working together, Jane and I designed a program that returned her to wellness. </p><p> One day she wanted to discuss a realization she had had, based on her meditation practice and reinforced by her travels around the country. She felt that something important was happening in the minds of people, but she couldn't put her finger on it. She asked me if I knew what it was. I told her that I saw the situation as more than just a change from the old way of treating people medically to a new way. The real shift we are witnessing today, I said, and still believe, is in how we look at the world in relation to ourselves. </p><p> I have written about the reasons behind this shift before. As I discussed in my book Meditation as Medicine, we are now entering a new age: the Age of Aquarius. Age shifts are natural phenomena that occur every two thousand years. Jesus Christ ushered in the previous transition, from the Age of Sagittarius to the Age of Pisces. Astrological scholars believe that the world changed again at midnight on November 11, 1991. At that moment the Age of Pisces ended and the Age of Aquarius began. Astrological transitions are marked by three seven-year periods totaling a twenty-one-year cusp. This current transition will end in 2012. Each seven-year stage brings with it accelerated change. I think you will agree that we are certainly seeing such a positive change now as people become more aware of their spiritual nature. But we are also witnessing the polar opposite of that positive change. The negative corollary in this age of transition includes an increase in terrorism, fear, violence, and rage. On a medical level, we can see a rising incidence of illnesses such as chronic fatigue and obesity, as well as escalating rates of some cancers. </p><p> The single most significant change we are witnessing in this Age of Aquarius is how it revolves around experience rather than information. In its initial stages, the Age of Aquarius still centered on information and its effects on us. For example, our collective quest for information led to the development of the personal computer and the rise of the Internet. During the information age, the cry was "I want to know, I want to know." While it is still useful, the desire for pure information for its own sake has subsided as we realize that what we need most is useful personal experience. As we ride the crest of the second seven years of this cusp, a new impulse has emerged. Now the shout is "I want an experience." This is readily apparent in many aspects of modern life -- in reality TV, for example, and in the increase in adventure travel. </p><p> This change in paradigm is especially vivid in the practice of medicine. Because patients have become so utterly discouraged with medical practice as driven by big business and HMOs, they now visit the offices of alternative medical practitioners in droves. In the 1980s, very few Americans had consulted an alternative medical practitioner, be it a nutritionist, yoga therapist, meditation expert, chiropractic physician, massage therapist, acupuncturist, or herbalist. However, in a 1991 Harvard study, this number had increased to 34 percent, and in 1999 over 50 percent of Americans had visited an alternative medical practitioner. This number is further climbing with every passing day. Extrapolation of the 1991 Harvard study suggests that Americans made an estimated 425 million visits to providers of alternative medicine in 1990 alone. The financial ramification of this shift to integrative medicine is staggering. Expenditures associated with unconventional medical therapy in 1990 were approximately $13.7 billion, three quarters of which was paid by patients out of their own pockets. These uninsured costs are now up to $27 billion, based on a survey reported recently by the New England Journal of Medicine. </p><p> The reason people are embracing integrative medicine is apparent. Patients crave the experience of wellness that this type of treatment gives. It is what I call the feeling of healing. You usually leave the office of an alternative medical doctor feeling a lot better than when you entered. You have hope and the experience of happiness. The practitioner usually spends quality time with you, asking questions and seeking feedback. It has been my experience that when conventional doctors see you they are rarely in the moment. Their minds seem to be elsewhere. Many people tell me that a trip to the doctor leaves them feeling like a number or a file, not a person. It's no wonder, then, that so many patients, even those with chronic illnesses, are bailing out of the system. For the most part, conventional medicine does little to provide them with a true healing experience. </p><p> However, because patients demand it, conventional medicine has been forced to integrate proven natural healing techniques into the standard care of surgery, radiation therapy, and drugs. Yet, there is still a long way to go. One reason the evolution toward alternative or holistic medicine becomes bogged down is that we are taught to rely on technology instead of on our lifestyles and ourselves to heal. We have been taught that optimal health, deep healing, satisfaction, gratification, happiness, and even God can be found out there somewhere. This concept of looking outside is simply not correct. All answers lie within. As long as words have been written, saints, sages, poets, writers, philosophers, and yogis have commented on this concept and shared this truth. About five hundred years ago, an Indian guru named Arjun clarified my favorite interpretation of this reality. He was known as the Fifth Master, the king of this world and the next. Here is what he wrote: </p><p> All things are within the heart,<br> The home of the self.<br> Outside there is nothing.<br> Those who look outside themselves<br> Are left wandering in doubt.<br> </p><p> Guru Arjun tells us that the truth we seek is within ourselves, and I agree. The answers to many of our greatest desires, needs, and longings are inside. We only need to learn how to retrieve them. </p><p> The most powerful vehicle for retrieving our longed-for answers is applied intelligence, which is the combination of information and experience. Applied intelligence brings true wisdom because it includes experience, usually on a deep level. Because times are changing, medicine must embrace change. It will do so for one simple reason: we, the people, want it to.<br> </p><p> <b>FORWARD TO THE FUTURE</b> </p><p> In his best-selling book Eating Well for Optimal Health, Andrew Weil, M.D., outlined his seven basic principles of diet and health. I'd like to repeat them here for you: </p><p> <br> </p></li><li>We have to eat to live.<br> </li><li>Eating is a major source of pleasure.<br> </li><li>Food that is healthy and food that gives pleasure are not mutually exclusive.<br> </li><li>Eating is an important focus of social interaction.<br> </li><li>How we eat reflects and defines our personal and cultural identity.<br> </li><li>How we eat is one determinant of health.<br> </li><li>Changing how we eat is one strategy for managing disease and restoring health.<br> <br> <p> From Eating Well for Optimal Health by Andrew Weil, M.D. Copyright 2000 by Andrew Weil, M.D. Used by permission of Alfred A. Knopf, a division of Random House, Inc. </p><p> I'm sure you will agree that all seven principles are reasonable and true. Nevertheless, I believe we can continue to go forward in our approach to food based on available new knowledge. We can begin with Dr. Weil's last principle and move beyond it with a new intensity. In the pages of this book, I will show you why it is so vitally important to leave your old nutritional habits of the past century behind and chart a new and different course. For example: </p><p> </p></li><li>I will tell you how food acts as a messenger to your genes and <br> </li><li>how you can use that knowledge to create vibrant health and healing.<br> </li><li>I will give you an introductory course on the latest scientific knowledge about why food is actually medicine for your body, mind, and spirit.<br> </li><li>I will share with you my new seven principles of eating a modern healing diet. You will learn about organic foods and determine how to identify them and where to find them. I will also tell you about the risks of genetically modified foods and how to avoid them.<br> </li><li>I will teach you how to gently and safely detoxify your body from the environmental pollutants you absorb every day.<br> </li><li>I will lead you to discover uncommon uses for common natural foods.<br> </li><li>I will teach you to craft special food combination diets for specific illnesses.<br> </li><li>I will teach you to use organic juices as natural medicines.<br> </li><li>I will show you how to institute specific vitamin and herbal therapies to accelerate healing.<br> </li><li>I will provide you with innovative recipes for meals that heal. Many of them come from my own family. My wife, Kirti, is Italian, and she is a wonderful cook. My son, Sat, is a professional natural food chef. My daughter, Hari, is a graduate of the New Mexico School of Natural Therapeutics. All of them have happily agreed to share some of their cooking ideas. Finally, with the blessings of my teacher, Yogi Bhajan, and his talented wife, Bibiji, I will instruct you on the preparation of spiritual nutrition recipes from the ancient healing tradition of yoga nutritional therapy.<br> <p> You will be asked to complete various assignments during the course of the book to determine your intake of food and help design the best diet for your ailment, issue, or conce...</p></li></p><h2>The Magic of M.C.Escher (Hardback 2nd ed.) /anglais</h2><p>Language:Chinese.HardCover Pub Date: 2006.

In the hands of Smurthwaite (<i>Fine Old High Priests</i>; <i>Letter by a Half Moon</i>), mid-century Portland, Ore., becomes a simple utopia, where neighbors knew neighbors (but did not intrude on their business), and kindness was the order of the day. Indeed, not one ugly incident mars the coming-of-age of protagonist Neal Rogers, which makes for some nostalgic moments but a not very compelling plot. Growing up as one of five children in a boxmaker's family, Neal experiences a loving Mormon childhood, full of the security of a stable home and a close-knit ward (congregation). Smurthwaite offers some sweet, even cloying, snatches of Mormon life, including a particularly endearing sketch about an awkward young couple who have to be urged into courtship by various members of the ward. However, the novella constantly switches from vignette to vignette, giving readers a paragraph of one and then confusing them with a paragraph of another, with very little to go on in the way of time frame, setting and character. The artistic result is a frenetic disorder that is precisely the opposite of the unhurried, cohesive sensibility Smurthwaite seeks to convey. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Preceded by initiation and oral instructions, the practitioner arrives at this view through the profound methods of deity visualization, mantra recitation, and meditative absorption.</p><p>Shechen Gyaltsap IV spent most of his life in retreat and was one of the main teachers of the late Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche.&#x201c;As more and more people embrace the Tibetan Buddhist path with sincerity and dedication, priceless instructions like these by the great masters of the past take on a crucial importance. Only with such clear and practical guidance can we fully appreciate the depth of the extraordinary practices of the Vajrayana, and discover for ourselves their transformative power.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sogyal Rinpoche, author of <i>The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying</i></p><h2>When Spring Comes</h2><p><p>The award-winning, bestselling husband-and-wife team of Kevin Henkes and Laura Dronzek collaborate for the first time since their acclaimed picture book <em>Birds</em>.

First presented during the reestablishment of the Anthroposophical Society at the Christmas Conference of 1923, it is a powerful and penetrating meditative text that many consider to be a key to the spiritual mysteries of our time. <br><br> This budget-priced pocket version features three alternative translations (by George Adams, Pauline Wehrle and Richard Seddon), along with the original German verses and an introduction by Michael Wilson.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Garfield Tips the Scales: His 8th Book</h2><p>You've made him the favorite cat of all time!<br><br>The GARFIELD CLASSICS series collects the early years of the Garfield comic strip in a larger, full-color format.

And what if a young clairvoyant named Amanda reestablishes the flea circus as popular entertainment and fertility worship as the principal religious form of our high-tech age? <b>Another Roadside Attraction</b> answers those questions and a lot more. It tell us, for example, what the sixties were truly all about, not by reporting on the psychedelic decade but by recreating it, from the inside out. In the process, this stunningly original seriocomic thriller is fully capable of simultaneously eating a literary hot dog and eroding the borders of the mind.</p><p>It's clear that when Robbins sits down to write, he has one thing on his mind: having himself some fun. I read <b>Another Roadside Attraction,</b> years ago, then immediately went back to the beginning of the book and read it again. Robbins holds nothing back in this, his first novel.

It was a place where, from the confines of her bedroom in the suburbs, she could write about personal style and chronicle the development of her own. Within two years, the blog was averaging fifty thousand hits per day. Soon fashion designers were flying her around the world to attend and write about fashion shows, and to be a guest of honor at their parties.<br></p><p>Soon Tavi&#x2019;s interests grew beyond fashion, into culture and art and, especially, feminism. In September 2011, when she was fifteen, she launched <i>Rookie</i> (http://rookiemag.com), a website for girls like her: teenagers who are interested in fashion and beauty but also in dissecting the culture around them through a uniquely teen-girl lens. Rookie broke one million page views within its first six days. <i>Rookie Yearbook One </i>collects articles, interviews, photo editorials, and illustrations from the highly praised and hugely popular online magazine.&nbsp;</p><p>In its first year, <i>Rookie</i> has established a large inclusive international community of avid readers. In addition to its fifty-plus regular writers, photographers, and illustrators (many of whom are teenage girls themselves), <i>Rookie</i>&#x2019;s contributors and interviewees have included prominent makers of popular culture such as Lena Dunham, Miranda July, Joss Whedon, Jon Hamm, Zooey Deschanel, David Sedaris, Elle Fanning, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, John Waters, Chloe Sevigny, Liz Phair, Dan Savage, JD Samson, Ira Glass, Aubrey Plaza, Daniel Clowes, Carrie Brownstein, Paul Feig, Bethany Cosentino, Kimya Dawson, Fred Armisen, and Winnie Holzman.</p><p>As a young teenager, Gevinson couldn&#x2019;t find what she was looking for in a teen magazine; <i>Rookie</i> is the one she created herself to fill that void. Her coolheaded intellect shines in <i>Rookie</i>, arguably the most intelligent magazine ever made for a teen-girl audience. Gevinson writes with a humble but keen authority on such serious topics as body image, self-esteem, and first encounters with street harassment. She&#x2019;s equally deft at doling out useful advice, such as how to do a two-minute beehive, or how to deliver an effective bitchface. <i>Rookie</i>&#x2019;s passionate staffers and faithful readers have helped make <i>Rookie</i> the strong community that it is.</p><p>To date, Gevinson has written for <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar</i>, <i>Jezebel</i>, <i>Lula</i>, and <i>Pop</i>, and is a contributing editor for <i>Garage</i> magazine.

Last year, with a little help from her friends, she launched online magazine Rookie. This title compiles the site&#x2019;s &#x201c;very best&#x201d; offerings through May 2012. In the book&#x2019;s welcome note, she asks, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t this weird, with no Cheeto-crumb-covered keyboard or Netflix streaming window between us? I&#x2019;m really into it.&#x201d; Though Rookie chalked up one million page views in less than a week after its launch, this eye-catching large-format paperback will be an exciting first exposure to this new brand of young, girl-power feminist journalism. Contributions and interviews by Gevinson, staff writers, Rookie readers, and stars address topics both silly and serious. Rotating &#x201c;Literally the Best Thing Ever&#x201d; and &#x201c;How To&#x201d; columns showcase, for example, Joni Mitchell and &#x201c;Approach the Person You Like without Throwing Up,&#x201d; respectively. The included pullout record, designer-made paper crown, and sheet of stickers will necessitate special care for circulation, but with wit and reason, Rookie combats the often ridiculous or destructive advice aimed at its audience, and it is a beacon for a smarter, more sensitive generation of young women. --Annie Bostrom</p><h2>Maigret and the Bum (Variant Title = Maigret and the Dossier)</h2><p>A homeless man is found beaten and unconscious along the banks of the Seine.

In this pioneering book, a Russian historian with exclusive access to newly opened Soviet archives on the war offers a compelling account of the Kremlin&#39;s role in Vietnam. Ilya Gaiduk shows that while Moscow sought to strengthen its position in Southeast Asia by providing its allies in Hanoi with substantial aid, Soviet leaders also feared an armed dispute involving the United States and worried about the breakdown of detente. In unexpected ways and to a surprising degree, the Soviets pursued a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Indochina on conditions that would be acceptable for the North Vietnamese and, in the long run, for Moscow. Privy to formerly secret documents, Mr. Gaiduk focuses on the trends and motives that influenced the Kremlin&#39;s decision-making process, and analyzes the USSR&#39;s position on Vietnam in light of its complex relations with the Communist world and the West. His eye-opening history will force a rethinking of many Western assumptions.</p><p>Ilya V. Gaiduk is a Fellow of the Institute of World History in the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. He has also written <i>The Soviet Union and the Vietnam War</i>. He lives in Moscow.Based partly on recently released archival documents, this noteworthy, nuanced study challenges previous views on Soviet policy toward the Vietnam War. Gaiduk, a Russian historian based in Moscow, reveals that in 1971, the Kremlin drew up plans to make Vietnam the U.S.S.R.'s main channel for Soviet influence in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, the Kremlin was apprehensive that the conflict might spread to other regions and develop into an East-West confrontation or a nuclear disaster. Consequently, Soviet leaders adopted a two-pronged policy, supplying economic and military aid to Hanoi on the one hand, but also making strenuous behind-the-scenes efforts to convince both North and South Vietnam of the need for a negotiated settlement. Another revelation is that North Vietnamese communist leaders, fearful of jeopardizing aid from Moscow, clandestinely kept Soviet diplomats in Paris informed of the contents of private meetings with Henry Kissinger. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Profiles in Courage</h2><p>The Illustrated Edition: The Pulitzer-Prize winning account of men of principle, integrity and bravery in American politics is now available in a handsome, illustrated format .

Desmond Alexander, Union Theological College, Belfast)<br><br>"Nothing else comes even close to this authoritative analysis of the destroying power of idolatry and its comparison to the renewing power of true worship of the one real God. Beale's relentlessly thorough coverage of the biblical material, using a purposely maximalist approach, gives the reader a close look at every possible reference to relevant passages, no matter how obscure or tangential, so that no stone is left unturned in demonstrating how idolatry--ancient or modern--ruins people's lives. Any biblical preacher or teacher would benefit from this book." (Douglas Stuart, professor of Old Testament, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)<br><br>"This stimulating and in-depth study on idolatry is vintage Greg Beale. Beale argues that we become like the idols we worship, and he makes his case through a careful intertextual study of the Scriptures. Insights abound as Beale unfolds the biblical text. We are reminded afresh that idolatry is the root sin, and that it is so heinous because it robs God of the glory and praise and honor that he alone deserves." (Thomas R. Schreiner, James Buchanan Harrison Professor of New Testament Interpretation, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary)<br><br>"This is an original, brilliant and most satisfying treatment of a theme central to biblical understanding, but often misunderstood or ignored in the modern church. This book requires careful study but it repays far more than it requires." (David F. Wells, Andrew Mutch Distinguished Professor of Historical and Systematic Theology, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)<br><br>"<em>We Become What We Worship</em> is biblical theology at its best, weaving together Old and New Testament texts into a unified message. Beale's work is original yet traditional, profound yet simple, exegetical yet 'hyperexegetical,' sometimes provocative yet always profitable, for the scholar yet for every serious Christian. His message that we resemble what we revere, either for ruin or for restoration, is convincing and convicting." (Bruce Waltke, professor of Old Testament, Reformed Theological Seminary)<br><br>"This thoughtful examination of a surprisingly significant biblical theme will richly reward all who read it. . . . It offers that rare combination of careful, insightful exegesis and perceptive application from which not only biblical scholars but all Christians can benefit." (Frank Thielman, Presbyterian Professor of Divinity, Beeson Divinity School)</p><h2>The Nature Doctor : A Manual of Traditional and Complementary Medicine</h2><p>The first British edition of this worldwide bestseller, The Nature Doctor, fully revised and updated, comes complete with comprehensive appendices, offering the reader easy access to wealth of information from the &#39;father&#39; of natural healing. Dr H. C. A. Vogel comes from a Swiss family where the secrets of herbalism were known and practised. From early childhood he was eager to learn about the healing powers of plants and bit by bit he collected and expanded the traditional and empirical knowledge of European folk-medicine. Since 1929 he has reported his experiences and observations as a nature practitioner, nutritionist, researcher of medicinal plants and discoverer of natural healing powers, in his monthly periodical Gesundheitsnachrichten (A. Vogel&#39;s Health News). First published in 1952, The Nature Doctor has become a recognised standard publication even among medical doctors and scientists.</p><p>From 1929 until his death, Dr H. C. A. Vogel reported on his experiences and observations as a nature practitioner, nutritionist, researcher of medicinal plants and discoverer of natural healing powers, in his monthly periodical, Gesundheitsnachrichten (A, Vogel&#39;s Health News).&#34;I carefully adhere to Dr Vogel&#39;s philosophies . . . this book will find a place in many households as a useful source of valuable information and sensible advice on treatment without side effects&#34; -- Jan de Vries, from the Foreword</p><h2>The Story of Inyo</h2><p>This book&#39;s purpose is to preserve, particularly, the record of Inyo County earlier than 1870, when a printed record began. Gathering data for some such purpose began more than twenty years ago, while many of the pioneers still lived. It was the author&#39;s good fortune to know personally every early-day Inyoite then in the county. Each of them, gladly gave his help. Personal interviews when possible, and correspondence with those who has moved to other parts of the country, elicited their recollections. All narratives were checked and rechecked with each other and with other sources of information. The principle matters since 1870 are presented by subjects, rather than with special regard to the order of their occurrence.</p><p></p><h2>Star Medicine: Native American Path to Emotional Healing</h2><p>A Native American shaman draws on both her traditions and her training in modern psychology to present a new approach to your emotional life. Seven ceremonies help you find inner strength and peace. To prepare you for your inner journey, complete and detailed instructions are provided for creating a sacred space where you are encircled by a wheel made of cornmeal and cleansed by the softly rising smoke of smoldering herbs. There you bring your spirit journal and other sacred tools, all clearly explained, and venture into vision with lessons from the entities of the spirit world. Each chapter features a shamanic story, a ceremony, and a vision to help you become more deeply in touch with the "dance of life." 192 pages, 23 b/w illus., 6 x 9. <br></p><p>To successfully travel the shamanic path, one must develop an understanding of the four elements that compose human beings: spirit, emotion, body, and mind. Wolf Moondance uses her rainbow medicine wheel to build a new interpretation of the vision quest based on the traditional foundations of Native American shamanic traditions. <i>Star Medicine</i>, the third book in her Rainbow Medicine series, focuses on the southern portion of the rainbow wheel, the domain of emotions. In this book, Moondance teaches ceremonies and dances of the South that can be performed by anyone with the desire and dedication. These dances are the way to spiritual visions, where lessons that show the magic of emotion are learned. Moondance delves into the spirit world alongside readers as she lights the path to discovery and connects visions with poetic accounts of her personal experiences on the rainbow wheel.</p><h2>The Corpse Wore Pasties (Hard Case Crime)</h2><p>WHO BUMPED OFF THE BUMP-AND-GRINDER?<br><br> Usually, when you call a burlesque act a &#x201c;show stopper,&#x201d; you don't mean it quite so literally. But this time, that's just what happened: The show stopped dead, and so did the girl. And as I looked at her nearly naked and completely lifeless body and the bottle of poison in her hand with my fingerprints all over it, I thought to myself: Porkpie, you're in for it this time...</p><p>Known to many as the burlesque mayor of New York City, <b>Jonny Porkpie</b> is the co-creator and host of New York&#x2019;s celebrated Pinchbottom burlesque troupe as well as an accomplished cartoonist, puppeteer, and author. Mr. Porkpie is often credited as a key figure in the widely reported burlesque revival.The self-styled burlesque mayor of New York City makes himself the hero of his entertaining hard-boiled debut. Suspected of murder after a striptease artist dies dramatically onstage, performer and emcee Porkpie--named for his trademark hat--sets out one kick-step ahead of the cops to find the real killer. It doesn't help that victim Victoria Vice was generally loathed for plagiarizing the distinctive acts of fellow ecdysiasts Cherries Jubilee, Jillian Knockers and Eva Desire. Much of the fun lies in Porkpie's witty and telling observations of life in the raunchy burlesque world, and the tone is more playful than pornographic despite plentiful references to sexual activity. Readers will enjoy the twists and action and hope for future Porkpie investigations. The book will be launched with a live burlesque show in New York City. --Publishers Weekly, October 19, 2009<br><br>Porkpie (not his real name?) is by trade an emcee/comic for neo-burlesque shows in NYC, a job where you immediately either stink or swim. Fortunately, the rapport required on stage transfers effortlessly to the page in this debut mystery. At the start our hero, also named Jonny, is seen onstage by an audience guilelessly administering real poison, in a bottle labeled "Poison," to one of the burlesque artistes who straight away flops over onto her pasties. It seems the victim was hated by the other performers on the bill, so Jonny has his work cut out proving his innocence and finding the real murderer while at the same time eluding the cops. Along the way he's subjected to rigorous slapstick workouts in a dominatrix's salon and finds himself, half-naked, dangling from the Brooklyn Bridge. Still he manages to hang onto his trademark porkpie hat--and dignity. Verdict: Don't give up your night job, Jonny; it's too good of a backdrop for the sequels that will surely come to nestle comfortably between Gypsy Rose Lee's classic 1941 The G-string Murders and Kinky Friedman's mysteries. --Bob Lunn, Library Journal, October 28, 2009<br><br>Author Porkpie, the self-proclaimed "Burlesque Mayor of New York City," makes himself the star of this winsome first novel. Porkpie is NYPD's prime suspect in the murder of Victoria Vice, a burlesque dancer known for "plagiarizing" other dancers' acts. Jonny assumes that one of the other dancers on the program is the murderer, and he decides he must uncover the truth to avoid 25 years in prison. In the course of his investigation, he is chased, half-naked, across the Brooklyn Bridge by a heavy-metal band and finds himself hanging from chains, completely naked, in the dungeon of a dominatrix. He also offers knowing insights into the craft of burlesque, for example, to properly apply pasties, heat the adhesive--it makes them stick better. Porkpie's style is diligently tongue in cheek, and it works. Fans of hard-boiled crime will enjoy this romp, and in an increasingly coarse popular culture, the inside look at burlesque seems, well, almost wholesome. --Booklist, October 14 2009</p><h2>A Heart So White</h2><p>Juan knows little about his widowed father Ranz, a man with a troubled past; if he has been told no lies, that is because he has asked no questions. All he does know is that before marrying Juan&#39;s mother Ranz was married to her elder sister and she had committed suicide. The unspoken dialogue between father and son, however, is to become a spelling out of the horrifying truth once Juan has been married for a year to Luisa, and the bride turns discreet confessor to the burdened old man. What gradually emerges into the cold light of day is a repetition of scenes already witnessed by Juan in the course of his travels - of a married man blackmailed by his mistress in a Havana hotel, of a woman in New York pursuing a sequence of shabby lovers through the lonely-hearts columns. With remarkable skill and delicacy Javier Marias builds up his colours to produce a startling picture of two generations, two marriages, and of the secret commerce between spouses that rests on the gossamer-thin threads of an unspoken accord.</p><p>Javier Mar�as is the author of several award-winning novels, including <i>All Souls</i>, <i>Dark Back of Time</i>, and <i>Tomorrow in the Battle Think On Me</i>.Text: English (translation) <br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Mill Girl: The Diary of Eliza Helsted, Manchester, 1842-1843 (My Story Series)</h2><p>Mill girl: the diary of Eliza heisted Manchester, 1842-1843( my story series)</p><p></p><h2>Living on the Edge: Dare to Experience True Spirituality</h2><p>Ingram gives a clear profile of what it means to be a follower of Jesus, with practical and specific means to live out that life authentically.</p><p>Chip serves as senior pastor of Venture Christian Church in Los Gatos, California, and is president of Living on the Edge--an international teaching and discipleship ministry.

My life did change. God did a radical work in my heart and planted a new set of desires within me. No one told me I had to read the Bible, but I couldn&#x2019;t put it down. I read it at night and in the morning with a sense that the living God was speaking directly to me. No one told me I had to stop &#x201c;doing this or that,&#x201d; but somehow God changed my desires . . . and the sin that I once enjoyed became repulsive. I had peace in my heart and often a song on my lips. I was free. I was motivated and wanted to share the love that I now experienced with everyone. </p><p><b></b></p><b><b>New Life/New Struggles</b></b> <p>But my new life also introduced new struggles. Although some sins quickly vanished, others seemed impossible to overcome. I was very fortunate to have some mature Christians enter my life shortly after my conversion and teach me how to live the Christian life. Little by little, I learned how to get to know God and understand His Word so He could talk back to me. The early days were filled with a joy that I&#x2019;d never known and followed by tests that I had never imagined. </p><p>As I read through my New Testament in the mornings and talked with God about school, basketball, and girls, I soon learned that His opinion about how to &#x201c;do&#x201d; life was a little bit different from mine. Jesus was certainly my Savior, but He was far from the Lord of my life. I was growing and confused. I felt such joy in my new relationship with Christ, but I didn&#x2019;t want anyone telling me what to do. Unconsciously I began to compartmentalize my faith (just like I observed in the church of my childhood) and took a salad-bar approach to God&#x2019;s commands. The ones that I liked and seemed reasonable I obeyed; and the ones that I disliked and seemed unreasonable I chose to disregard. </p><p>As I look back, it was a crazy way to live. I read my Bible in the mornings and had a wonderful time with God, only to experience extreme remorse and guilt later in the day as I engaged in activities that violated the Holy Spirit living within me. I looked forward to Thursday-night Bible study, where our campus ministry would crowd into a small living room to sing songs, share our hearts, and experience God&#x2019;s presence in a powerful way. </p><p>On Friday and Saturday nights I would load in the car with four or five players on the basketball team and hit every bar in Wheeling, West Virginia. I was the one with the social skills, so I was appointed the designated &#x201c;introducer&#x201d; to the good-looking girls. Often getting home in the wee hours of the morning, I would miss church, feel guilty, ask for forgiveness, receive it, and continue on with this schizophrenic Christian life. </p><p>Though I didn&#x2019;t show it, I was miserable. Over time the joy of the Lord began to fade as I constantly violated my conscience, and even the sin I once enjoyed lost its ability to satisfy, as it was always accompanied with guilt and shame&#x2014;now that I had the Holy Spirit living in me. </p><p>It was about two and a half years into my journey with Christ that God had me revisit those two very important questions: &#x201c;What is it that God really wants from me the most? And how do I give it to Him?&#x201d; It was these two questions that brought me to a point of seriously reexamining my relationship with the living God. </p><p><b></b></p><b><b>Giving God What He Really Wants</b></b> <p>As I was reading through the Scripture one day with a group of guys my age, I realized that my double, compartmentalized life had never been God&#x2019;s intent. He wanted <i>me</i>&#x2014;all of me! The missing power and the absent joy could only come as I understood and applied the truth of Romans 12:1 . . . only when I learned about surrender. </p><p>God wanted me to surrender all that I am and all that I have in submission to Him. He wanted to have the same place in my heart that He possesses in the universe. He wanted me to believe that He was so good, kind, and loving that I would entrust all of me to Him, knowing He had my best in mind. He wanted me to bring my dreams, my future, my girlfriend, my basketball career, my academics to Him with open palms. He wanted me to bring my everything so that He might reign in my heart as He reigns in the universe. </p><p>I cannot begin to tell you the extent of the struggle and battle I experienced in coming to a place of surrender. My view of God was so warped that I assumed to surrender to Him would mean the end of the things that I held most dear. </p><p>Surrender and fear were synonymous in my mind and heart. I was single and certainly wanted to be married someday. But I thought if I surrendered to God, He might want me to be single and I would be miserable my whole life. Or worse, He would direct me to marry some ugly girl whom I never wanted to be with. If I surrendered, He might ask me to quit basketball and send me to some strange land to be a missionary. If I surrendered, He might want me to change what I was studying to something different that I would probably hate. Over and over in my mind the issue of surrender became paramount. </p><p>As I look back, I see that it was my misunderstanding of God and the concept of surrender that destined me to be a cultural, carnal, hypocritical follower of Jesus&#x2014;the very thing I had hated growing up. </p><p>I wanted to begin our journey together by sharing my story of struggling with the Christian life, because according to the best research and my personal experience, the great majority of &#x201c;Christians&#x201d; in the United States and around the world live in this great twilight. </p><p>Believers who know and love God and yet do not experience His joy, power, or presence anywhere near the way God longs for them to know Him. </p><p>It was my misunderstanding of God and the concept of surrender that destined me to be a cultural, carnal, hypocritical follower of Jesus&#x2014;the very thing i had hated growing up. </p><p>If you&#x2019;re tired of all the rules, all the formulas, all the religious activities, and even well-meaning church programs that promise transformation but don&#x2019;t deliver, I invite you to join me on a journey of grace, faith, and relationship that leads to genuine transformation. Together we&#x2019;ll learn what it really looks like to follow Christ and how in His power and grace, you can live a new, radical, abundant life. </p><p>In order for this to occur it will require your participation. Reading or even agreeing with what Scripture says about spiritual transformation does not make it happen. So at the end of each chapter I will provide you some key questions, assignments, and resources to help you process and apply what God is saying to you. </p><p>I use the acronym TRUST ME to remind you that what pleases God the most is our faith (Hebrews 11:6). You will be tempted to see r12 as the &#x201c;bar of discipleship&#x201d; that you need to achieve instead of the profile of what Christ wants to produce in your heart and relationship through His power and grace. </p><p>Don&#x2019;t feel compelled to answer all the questions at the end of each chapter or do all the assignments. They are there to help you hear God&#x2019;s voice, overcome common barriers, and cooperate with the Holy Spirit&#x2019;s work in your heart&#x2014;not to be another list of things you need to do. The most important question you can ask at the end of each chapter (and in all circumstances for that matter) is &#x201c;What does it look like to trust God? What does it look like to trust God in view of what I just read? What does it look like to trust God in my job, my relationships, my future, etc.?&#x201d; </p><p>TRUST ME will walk you through a grace-oriented process to help you hear what God is saying to you. Let&#x2019;s get started in this first chapter on surrender: </p><p><b></b></p><b><b>IT&#x2019;S YOUR MOVE&#x2014;Become an Christian</b></b> <p>God longs to speak personally to you. Take two minutes and slowly read through the TRUST ME questions and suggestions for spiritual growth. Then sit quietly for three minutes and ask God which of those questions or actions might provide a pathway that will strengthen and encourage you. Don&#x2019;t feel compelled to answer all the questions or do all that is suggested; listen to the Holy Spirit and follow His leading. </p><p></p><i><br><b>THINK</b>&#x2014;What part of my struggle with surrender spoke to you?<br><b>REFLECT</b>&#x2014;Why do you think that aspect of my story resonated in your heart?<br><b>UNDERSTAND</b>&#x2014;How might God be speaking to you? Are you afraid? Convicted? Relieved that others have the same struggles?<br><br><b>SURRENDER</b>&#x2014;Take a moment and simply tell God how you are feeling. Share your fears, relief, or honest struggles with Him.

She grew up on a farm in Maine much like the one in this story. She lives in Mt. Vernon, Iowa.A meaty tale of the quest for an uncatchable fish named Oscar is told in folksy, irresistible language. Simon Henry's outstanding features are his ability to catch any fish and brag about it, his unsociable temperament, and his tight boots. In pursuit of his passion, he ignores even the ``Friday-Night-Potluck-Everybody-Come-and-Fling'' party in town. One day, Potato Kelly, female proprietor of the bait and chowder shop, tells him of the ``crafty, bait-grasping catfish'' in local waters, and the chase is on. The two odd-looking middle-aged characters wager with each other in colorful phrases about Simon Henry's ability to succeed. Since his socks ``were beginning to smell worse that sour milk, worse than secret-recipe stinkbait,'' he uses them as a lure. The catfish clamps on and tows the fishing boat like the shark in Jaws, finally leaving only half a sock behind. Simon Henry must do all the humiliating things he promised, and Oscar lives on, singing in the deep hole by Higgins Bend. The watercolor illustrations exaggerate as much as the text: Figures and landscapes sway with the artist's lyrical lines; perspectives as if from odd camera lenses distort and amuse. Some of the townspeople look quite goofy, but they also look familiar, in a tale clearly fished from American waters. (Picture book. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The photographs, map, and Nisbet&#39;s poetic style create an inspired chronicle of this region.</p><p>Jack Nisbet is also the author of Sources of the River, Purple Flat Top, and The Mapmakers Eye. He lives in Spokane, WA.Whether wading through the waters of the Columbia River or walking through the woods, biologist and history teacher Nisbet finds the remains of the Pacific Northwest's past and goes to great lengths to explain how these remnants got there. Nisbet (Sources of the River; Purple Flat Top; etc.), whose blood races when he touches ancient things, finds a trilobite fossil and is flushed with warmth, despite being knee-deep in icy water. He begins with historical accounts of trilobites and salamanders, and quickly moves up the evolutionary ladder to mammoths and even humans. He catalogues numerous historical encounters with California condors, including an amusing one in which naturalist John Kirk Townsend winged a condor along the Willamette River in 1835. Shedding his clothes and gun, Townsend crossed the river and, completely naked. battled the condor, which had a 10-foot wingspan, until he managed to knock the bird unconscious by hitting it with a well-thrown stone. The author also reports humankind's less victorious encounters with nature, including the terrible toll that smallpox and other diseases took on the Native American tribes of the Northwest. Although Nisbet's histories can veer into litanies (he cites more than 20 condor encounters), his passion and attention to detail will make this an informative read for nature lovers and historians of the Pacific Northwest.

But with the exhilarating rush of success comes a price-and a battle to recapture the traditions that were her foundation. Struggling to reconnect with the things that matter most, Destiny is putting an unexpected new spin on her own career-one that will redirect her professional and personal life in ways she never imagined. Written with genuine heart and emotion, Wynonna Judd's accessible debut novel is a celebration of family and friends, of love and loss, of success and surrender, and of one woman's inspiring path of self- discovery.</p><p>Wynonna Judd came into prominence as part of the legendary mother-daughter duo, The Judds, selling more than twenty million records worldwide and winning more than sixty industry awards. Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Wynonna now lives in Nashville with her children, cats, dogs, buffalo, and deer. Restless Heart is her first novel.<b>One<br>Nashville, Tennessee</b><p>"I have good news and bad news," Ralph Weston said. "Which do you want first?"</p><p>Of all the ridiculous questions Destiny Hart had been asked since she moved to Nashville to try and make it in the country music business&#x2014;and there were many&#x2014;that had to be her least favorite.</p><p>Leaning her guitar case against the dingy white wall in the employee break room, she pasted on a smile and turned to face her boss.</p><p>"Go ahead&#x2014;hit me with the bad news," she answered, just as his cell phone beeped.</p><p>"Hang on a second." Ralph flipped open his phone.</p><p>Waiting for him to check his text messages, Destiny held her breath, though she could pretty much guess what he was going to tell her. </p><p><i>Shouldn't you be used to bad news by now?</i> she asked herself wearily. Lately, it was one thing after another, capped off by&#x2014; </p><p><i>No. Don't even go there.</i> </p><p>Every time she thought about what Billy Jackson had done to her, she felt sick inside. </p><p>Ralph looked up from his phone at last. "Listen, Destiny, Mandy called a few minutes ago. She's feeling better and she'll be able to perform, so we don't need you to sing tonight after all." </p><p>Destiny deflated. "Oh... okay." </p><p>Yep&#x2014;she'd been right. Mandy Mason pulled this stunt all the time. </p><p>Destiny longed to ask why Ralph why he put up with such unprofessional behavior, but she already knew the answer. All Mandy had to do was bat her big brown eyes and flip her blond hair, and she had Ralph&#x2014;and countless other red-blooded men&#x2014;eating right out of her hand. </p><p>Watching Ralph sneak another peek at his text messages, wearing a goofy grin, Destiny couldn't resist saying, "So she's feeling much better, huh?" </p><p>"Yeah, this text here says she's making the effort just for me." </p><p>Destiny swallowed a groan. She'd done some crazy things in an effort to catch a break in this business, but flirting with her middle-aged boss was one horse she wasn't willing to ride. </p><p>She cleared her throat loudly. </p><p>"Sorry, Destiny." Ralph glanced up and had the decency to show a little bit of remorse. </p><p>Maybe Destiny couldn't bring herself to flirt, but she had no problem pouncing on Ralph's guilt. "Well, since I came in, do you think I could sing a song or two? You know, to warm up the crowd for Mandy?" she added with a smile that felt more like a wince. </p><p>"Mmm..." He shoved his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels. "Last time we did that Mandy wasn't none too happy 'bout it."</p><p>"Oh... really? I wonder why. As I recall, I really had the crowd rockin'. You know, for her benefit, of course." </p><p>Ralph scratched his salt-and-pepper beard. "Mandy said you had the crowd too wound up for her style of singin'. Said you're too rough around the edges to open for her again." </p><p>Trying not to choke on her anger, Destiny managed to say calmly, "Mr. Weston, it's Friday night in Nashville. Getting fired up is what it's all about." </p><p>He didn't like being called Mr. Weston, but she'd been brought up to respect her elders. She just couldn't call her boss Ralph or, heaven forbid, Ralphie, as Mandy called him. </p><p>"I know you like to get people up on the dance floor a-hootin' and a-hollerin' and that's all well and good, Destiny, but Mandy likes her performance to be all about the music and her voice. You might want to make note of that for future reference." </p><p><i>And you might want to make a note that Mandy is playing you like a fiddle.</i> </p><p>Destiny dug deep for a smile. "I will do that. Now, what's the good news?" </p><p>"The good news is we need you on the floor tonight, so your trip here wasn't for nothin'." He eyed her Western-cut fringed shirt. "You've got your uniform, I hope?" </p><p>"In my locker," Destiny said glumly. While she needed the money&#x2014;desperately, thanks to Billy Jackson&#x2014;she wanted cash from the tip jar, not from waiting tables. </p><p>"Good." Ralph absently checked his phone once more, then added, "Oh and, Destiny?" </p><p>"Yes, sir?" </p><p>"You might want to pull back that hair of yours." </p><p>"Yes, sir." Destiny touched the light brown curls tumbling over her shoulders. </p><p>"Now get your tail on out there." Ralph jerked his thumb over his shoulder. "We're packed." </p><p>She started toward her locker, grumbling under her breath, "Well, isn't that just great." </p><p>"Excuse me?" </p><p>"I... uh..." She gave him a tight smile. "I said that I just can't wait." </p><p>"Remember, Mandy likes sweet tea to wet her whistle while she sings. Make sure you keep her glass full with lots of ice and a slice of lemon, okay?" </p><p>"Yes, sir." </p><p>With Ralph safely out of earshot, Destiny yanked her locker open. "Make sure you keep her glass full with lots of ice! Blah, blah... blah!" </p><p>Catching sight of herself in the mirror attached to her locker door, she saw tears threatening to wash away the smoky gray shadow she'd painstakingly applied to bring out the blue for tonight's performance, along with a soft pink gloss on her full lips. </p><p><i>See? You shouldn't have bothered,</i> she told her reflection. </p><p>She'd never been big on primping. But tonight she'd gone all out&#x2014;not just makeup, but perfume, too, and instead of the flats she usually wore to play down her height, she wore her ruby-red designer heels. They'd cost her a week's paycheck and a diet of cheap canned soup for a month, but she'd always thought they were worth it. </p><p>Until now. </p><p>Never mind her overdue rent, overdrawn checking account, and maxed-out credit cards. As she glanced down at the sexy red shoes peeking out from beneath her boot-cut Levi's, she knew her dogs were gonna be barkin' by the end of her shift. </p><p>After carefully angling her guitar case to fit into the locker, she reached for the extra T-shirt and apron she kept there as insurance against the spills and smears that Destiny could never seem to avoid. </p><p>Her daddy, who'd taught her to always be prepared, would be proud. </p><p>Daddy... </p><p>Destiny swallowed a wave of homesickness. Even now, four years after leaving Wilmot, she still had her moments when she wondered whether she'd made the right choice in defying her parents' wishes. </p><p>They'd never gotten over her decision to come to Nashville instead of going to college&#x2014;a plan she'd hatched on a whim after winning the Kentucky Idol competition, thanks to Cooper's dare. </p><p>How could she expect her parents to understand what it was like to perform? How could they grasp that the crowd's approval, in that brief, shining moment, somehow fulfilled a need that Destiny didn't even know she possessed? Even she hadn't understood the fierce calling. </p><p><i>Sometimes, I still don't. </i></p><i><p>Especially on nights like these. </p></i><p></p><p>She only knew that while her family traveled all over the country, moving from base to base, she had never developed a sense of belonging. Every new school, new air force base meant trying to fit in all over again, needing so much to be liked... accepted. Grace had her tumbling and her cheerleading and always found an instant group of friends. </p><p>Destiny had to work harder at it. Yes, she'd made good, solid friends when her family finally settled in Wilmot, but graduation was going to take them in separate directions, and that had unnerved her. Everyone else seemed to know where they wanted to go and what they wanted to do. </p><p>Everyone but Destiny. </p><p>Then she stood up there on that stage and sang "America the Beautiful," and she felt acceptance. It was such a tingling, trembling rush of instant gratification, as if all her life she'd been drifting and had finally found dry land. </p><p>She knew right then that, God willing, performing was what she wanted to do for the rest of her life. She simply wanted to sing and make people happy. </p><p>Her father had made it quite clear that he wasn't going to fund what he called her crazy whim. In all fairness, most parents would have protested. </p><p>But most parents probably would have gotten over it by now. </p><p>Not Daddy. Things between them had never been the same again. </p><p>She didn't need his money, though&#x2014;nor his blessing. Not in the beginning. </p><p>The Kentucky Idol prize was three thousand dollars and a chance to compete against forty-nine other state idol winners for a recording contract with a major label. </p><p>Destiny honestly had believed she had a shot at the grand prize. But after a grueling competition, the winner was a fresh-faced thirteen-year-old from Utah. Destiny was second runner-up&#x2014;after a twenty-something New York stud-muffin who'd been on Broadway most of his life and knew how to charm the judges. </p><p>In the end, the runner-up prize money&#x2014;combined with what she'd won earlier&#x2014;was enough to pay the rent on a Nashville apartment for a year. She promised her parents that if she hadn't made strides in the music industry by the time the year was up, she'd move back home and go to college. </p><p>Once she'd gotten a good taste of life in Nashville, Destiny knew there was no turning back. She'd decided she had indeed made strides&#x2014;by her own definition, anyway&#x2014;and she was here to stay. Her parents had no choice but to live with her decision. </p> <p>In the tiny employee bathroom, she slipped out of her fringed shirt, tugged the hunter-green tee over her head, and tied on her apron with its Back in the Saddle Bar and Grille logo stitched in bold black letters beneath a cowboy sitting on a bucking bronco. </p><p>Ralph might be clueless in other ways, but he knew how to run a restaurant. The restaurant wasn't even located on the famous Honky-Tonk Row, yet tourists, locals, and the occasional celebrity poured in daily for the juicy burgers, hand-cut French fries, and of course, the music. </p><p>Legend had it that Tammy Turner, one of country's all-time greats, had been discovered on the stage right here at Back in the Saddle. She still came in from time to time, Ralph claimed, although Destiny had never caught a glimpse of her. </p><p>Back at her locker, she hung up her shirt and quickly pulled out her cell phone. Her sister, Grace, had called twice today, leaving messages both times. Destiny had been so busy preparing to go onstage tonight that she hadn't yet called her back. </p> <p>She'd better do it now, though, before her shift started. </p><p>Quickly, she dialed Grace's number, wondering what was up, suddenly missing her sister desperately. </p><p>Close enough in age to be peers, Destiny and Grace had been the best of friends throughout their childhood. In a family constantly on the move, all they'd really had was each other. They shared everything from bedrooms to worry about their father whenever he was on active duty to a longing to settle down in one place and never have to move again. </p><p>Oddly enough, when that finally happened, the sisters drifted apart. Over the past four years that Grace had been in college and Destiny in Nashville, they'd seen each other only on rare occasions when they both happened to make it back home for the same holiday. Even then, Destiny never stuck around more than a night or two&#x2014;not because she had anything urgent to rush back to, but because she wanted her family to think she did. </p><p>Now that Grace had graduated and was living back in Wilmot, she seemed at loose ends for the first time in her life. Her old friends had scattered, her local job hunt wasn't going well, and her long-distance relationship with her college boyfriend had had more downs than ups. </p><p>She'd called a couple of times recently, offering to come visit Destiny in Nashville. </p><p>"That would be great," Destiny told her, but kept putting her off about a date, saying she was too busy working on her demo. </p><p>Ha. Look how that had turned out, thanks to Billy Jackson and her own gullibility. </p><p>Anyway, she wasn't too busy for visitors&#x2014;she was too ashamed to admit that her dreams were a long way from coming true. She couldn't bear to disappoint her family and friends; it was bad enough having disappointed herself. </p><p>Grace answered on the first ring, sounding so grateful for the returned call that Destiny instantly felt guilty. </p><p>"How have you been?" Grace asked. "Have you been working on branding yourself, like I told you?" </p><p>Destiny sighed. Her sister the business major had urged her to come up with a tagline of sorts&#x2014;a short description of her music that encapsulated the unique style that set her apart from other artists. </p><p>"Not yet. I've been busy." </p><p>"I'm sure you have. Have you gotten a record label deal yet?" </p><p>"Um... not yet." </p><p>"I know it'll be any second now." </p><p>"I sure hope so." But that would be a miracle, considering that Billy Jackson&#x2014;and the truckload of demos he had allegedly produced for her&#x2014;had vanished into thin air. </p><p>She quickly changed the subject. "What's new with you, Gracie?" </p><p>"Hmmm, let's see. I broke up with Jason." </p><p>"You're kidding." </p><p>"No, and don't say it was about time. I know he's a jerk." </p><p>"I wasn't going to say it." Destiny opened her purse to look for a ponytail band. </p><p>"Yeah, but you were thinking it. Apparently everyone was, but that's another story. I guess I was just blinded by his charm." </p><p>Cute, blond, and petite, Grace would have no problem replacing Jason, as far as Destiny was concerned. </p><p>"How's the job search going?" </p><p>"About as well as my love life. Apparently, a marketing degree doesn't hold much weight here in Wilmot." </p><p>"Maybe you should move to a bigger city," Destiny suggested, knowing Grace would never take her advice. She was a hometown girl through and through, as eager to put down roots as their mother had been through all the years of air force wandering. </p><p>Destiny and Grace had gone to nine different schools before their father retired and moved the family to Wilmot. They'd been so happy not to have to move anymore... </p><p><i>And then I did.</i> </p><p>She'd never forget her first day in Nashville. Cooper and Annie had come to help move her into her dumpy apartment. She'd refused to let them see that she found the place less than inviting, or that she was on the verge of tears the whole time they were there. </p><p>After they'd driven off into the hot August night, the dust settled and an eerie silence crept into the apartment. Unnerved, Destiny climbed out onto her fire escape. In the distance, in some honky-tonk down the street, she could hear someone singing a cover of "Friends in Low Places." Even now, whenever she heard that song, it took her back to that night, and the good hard cry she'd had on the fire escape. </p><p>Her own reaction to the move caught her off guard. She'd been so used to moving because of her daddy's military career that it never occurred to her that the move to Nashville would be traumatic. But she'd forgotten one important thing: This time, she'd be totally alone,leaving not just her friends, but her family behind. She was suddenly on her own for the first time in her life, without the support of her parents. They weren't there to hug her hard and wish her well the way they would have if she'd gone off to college. </p><p>But now that she'd lived longer here in Nashville than anywhere, including Wilmot, she was starting to feel restless. Maybe she didn't even know how to live in the same place or understand the concept...</p></p><h2>Good Morning, Monster: Five Heroic Journeys to Recovery</h2><p><b>A therapist creates moving portraits of five of her most memorable patients, men and women she considers psychological heroes.</b><br><br>Catherine Gildiner is a bestselling memoirist, a novelist, and a psychologist in private practice for twenty-five years. In <i>Good Morning, Monster</i>, she focuses on five patients who overcame enormous trauma--people she considers heroes. With a novelist's storytelling gift, Gildiner recounts the details of their struggles, their paths to recovery, and her own tale of growth as a therapist.<br><br>The five cases include a successful but lonely musician suffering sexual dysfunction; a young woman whose father abandoned her and her siblings in a rural cottage; an Indigenous man who'd endured great trauma at a residential school; a young woman whose abuse at the hands of her father led to a severe personality disorder; and a glamorous workaholic whose negligent mother had greeted her each morning with "Good morning, Monster." <br><br>Each patient presents a mystery, one that will only be unpacked over years. They seek Gildiner's help to overcome an immediate challenge in their lives, but discover that the source of their suffering has been long buried. It will take courage to face those realities, and creativity and resourcefulness from their therapist.<br><br>Each patient embodies self-reflection, stoicism, perseverance, and forgiveness as they work unflinchingly to face the truth. Gildiner's account of her journeys with them is moving, insightful, and sometimes humorous. It offers a behind-the-scenes look into the therapist's office and explains how the process can heal even the most unimaginable wounds.</p><p>CATHERINE GILDINER has been a clinical psychologist in private practice for twenty-five years. Her bestselling memoir <i>Too Close to the Falls</i> was published in Canada, the US, and the UK to wide acclaim in 1999. It had two sequels: <i>After the Falls</i> and <i>Coming Ashore</i>, also bestsellers. Her novel,<i> Seduction</i>, was a national bestseller. She lives in Toronto.The day I opened my private practice as a psychologist, I sat smugly in my office. Fortified with the knowledge I&#x2019;d acquired, taking comfort in the rules I&#x2019;d learned, I looked forward to having patients I could &#x201c;cure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was deluded. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I had no idea at the time what a messy business clinical psychology was or I may have opted for pure research, an area where I&#x2019;d have control over my subjects and variables. Instead, I had to learn how to be flexible as new information trickled in weekly. I had no idea on that first day that psychotherapy wasn&#x2019;t the psychologist solving problems but rather two people facing each other, week after week, endeavouring to reach some kind of psychological truth we could agree on. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one brought this home to me more than Laura Wilkes, my first patient. She was referred to me through a general practitioner, who in his recorded message said, &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll fill you in on the details.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t know who was more frightened, Laura or I. I was newly transformed from a student in jeans and a T-shirt to a professional, decked out in a silk blouse and a designer suit with linebacker shoulder pads, <i>de rigueur </i>in the early eighties. I sat behind my huge mahogany desk looking like a cross between Anna Freud and Joan Crawford. Luckily I had prematurely white hair in my twenties, which added some much-needed gravitas to my demeanour. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laura was barely five feet high, with an hourglass figure, huge almond eyes, and such full lips that had it been thirty years later, I would have suspected Botox injections. She had masses of shoulder-length blond highlighted hair and her porcelain skin contrasted sharply with her dark eyes. Perfect makeup, with bright red lipstick, set off her features. She was chic in spike heels, a tailored silk blouse, and a black pencil skirt. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said she was twenty-six, single, and working in a large securities firm. She&#x2019;d started out as a secretary but had been pro�moted to the human resources department. <br> When I asked how I could help her, Laura sat for a long time looking out the window. I waited for her to tell me the problem. I continued to wait in what&#x2019;s called a therapeutic silence&#x2014;an uncomfortable quiet that&#x2019;s supposed to elicit truth from the patient. Finally, she said, &#x201c;I have herpes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked, &#x201c;Herpes zoster or herpes simplex?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The kind you get if you&#x2019;re totally filthy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Sexually transmitted,&#x201d; I translated.<br> When I asked whether her sexual partner knew he had herpes, Laura replied that Ed, her boyfriend of two years, had said he didn&#x2019;t. However, she&#x2019;d found a pill vial in his cabinet that she rec�ognized as the same medication she&#x2019;d been prescribed. When I questioned her about this, she acted as though it was normal and that there wasn&#x2019;t much she could do about it. She said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Ed. I&#x2019;ve already ripped a strip off him. What more can I do?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That blas� reaction suggested that Laura was used to selfish and duplicitous behaviour. She&#x2019;d been referred to me, she said, because the strongest medication wasn&#x2019;t limiting the constant outbreaks and her doctor thought she needed psychiatric help. But Laura was clear about having no desire to be in therapy. She just wanted to get over the herpes. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I explained that in some people stress is a major trigger for attacks of the latent virus. She said, &#x201c;I know what the word <i>stress </i>means but I don&#x2019;t know exactly how it feels. I don&#x2019;t think I have it. I just keep on keeping on, surrounded by the village idiots.&#x201d; Not much had bothered her in her life, Laura told me, although she did acknowledge that the herpes had shaken her like nothing else.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I tried to reassure her by letting her know that one in six people aged fourteen to forty-nine has herpes. Her response was &#x201c;So what? We&#x2019;re all in the same filthy swamp.&#x201d; Switching tacks, I told her I understood why she was upset. A man who purported to love her had betrayed her. Plus, she was in pain&#x2014;in fact, she could barely sit. The worst part was the shame; forever after she&#x2019;d have to tell anyone she ever slept with that she had herpes or was a carrier. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laura agreed, but the worst aspect for her was that although she&#x2019;d done everything possible to rise above her family circum�stances, she was now wallowing in filth, just as they always had. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like quicksand,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;No matter how hard I try to crawl out of the ooze and slime, I keep getting sucked back in. I know; I&#x2019;ve almost died trying.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I asked her to tell me about her family, she said she wasn&#x2019;t going to go into &#x201c;all that bilge.&#x201d; Laura explained that she was a practical person and wanted to decrease her stress, <i>whatever that was</i>, so that she could get the painful herpes under control. She&#x2019;d planned to attend this one session, where I&#x2019;d either give her a pill or &#x201c;cure&#x201d; her of &#x201c;stress.&#x201d; I broke the news to her that stress, or anxiety, was occasionally easy to relieve but could sometimes be intransi�gent. I explained that we&#x2019;d need to have a number of appointments so that she could learn what stress is and how she experienced it, uncover its source, and then find ways to alleviate it. It was possible, I told her, that so much of her immune system was fighting stress that there was nothing left to fight the herpes virus. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe I have to do this. I feel like I came to have a tooth pulled and by mistake my whole brain came with it.&#x201d; Laura looked disgusted, but she finally capitulated. &#x201c;Okay, just book me for one more appointment.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#x2019;s difficult to treat a patient who isn&#x2019;t psychologically oriented. Laura just wanted her herpes cured and, in her mind, therapy was a means to that end. Nor did she want to give a family history, since she had no idea how it would be relevant. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two things I hadn&#x2019;t anticipated on my first day of therapy. First, how could this woman not know what stress is? Second, I&#x2019;d read hundreds of case studies, watched lots of therapy tapes, attended dozens of grand rounds, and in none of them did the patient refuse to give a family history. Even when I worked the night shift in psychiatric hospitals&#x2014;where they warehoused the lost psychological souls in back wards&#x2014;I&#x2019;d never heard anyone object. Even if they said, as one did, that she was from Nazareth and her parents were Mary and Joseph, they gave a history. Now my very first patient had refused! I realized that I&#x2019;d have to proceed in Laura&#x2019;s weird way, and at her own pace, or she&#x2019;d be gone. I remember writing on my clipboard, <i>My first task is to engage Laura.</i></p><h2>The Complete Guide to Sharpening (Fine Woodworking)</h2><p><p>You know how frustrating it is to work wood with tools that are dull.

I know of no other program quite like it."<br>--<strong>Mike Licona, apologetics &amp; interfaith evangelism, Director North American Mission Board (SBC)</strong><br><br>"Truth is best communicated in the realm of interpersonal relationships. And the best conduit for establishing relationships is the fine art of soul-searching conversation. As such, <strong><em>Conversational Evangelism</em></strong> is a vital tool for communicating the Gospel in a nonthreatening, pre-evangelistic manner. This fresh pre-evangelism model is seeker-sensitive, Word-centered, and purpose-driven. It is designed to win a hearing, much as Jesus did when He engaged in conversational evangelism with the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well (John 4)." <br>--<strong>Rev. Edmund Chan, senior pastor Covenant Evangelical Free Church, Singapore, and author of <em>Built To Last</em> and <em>Growing Deep in God</em></strong><br><br>"Most courses on evangelism teach us how to harvest, which creates a mentality that is very event and closure driven. Yet in real life, conversion is much more a process that takes place over time. <strong><em>Conversational Evangelism</em></strong> opens our eyes to the amount of work we have to invest in understanding a person prior to the time that we can really present the gospel. We look forward to turning it into a core course we will encourage all our members to attend."<br>--<strong>Peter Lin, congregational pastor, Grace Baptist Church, Singapore</strong><br><br>"One of the burdens of pastors is how to motivate their congregation to share their faith. Norman and David Geisler have come up with an approach that I strongly commend to help train and spur our people to win the lost amongst us." <br>--<strong>Dan Foo, senior sastor, Bethesda (Bedok-Tampines) Church, Singapore</strong><br><br>"This is the first time I have seen apologetics being used as a significant tool for personal evangelism. It has altogether reshaped my understanding of apologetics and evangelism. I wholeheartedly recommend this training to any Christian or church committed to soul-winning."<br>--<strong>Rev. Ng Koon Sheng, Anglican minister, Saint Andrews Cathedral, Singapore</strong><br><br>"Norman and David Geisler have done the Body of Christ a tremendous favor with their book, <em><strong>Conversational Evangelism</strong></em>.&nbsp; It is long&nbsp; overdue...For those who are Christ's witnesses in postmodern times, <strong><em>Conversational Evangelism</em></strong> is a must read."<br><strong>--Bill Perry, Chief of Staff, Director of Training Materials InterFACE Ministries</strong></p><h2>Northwest Home Landscaping: Including Western British Columbia</h2><p><b><i>Northwest Home Landscaping, including Western British Columbia</i></b> is an updated, expanded edition of Creative Homeowner's award-winning best seller on landscaping northwest-style.

Preparations range from Country Captain to Carolina Chicken Bog to Chicken and Parslied Dumplings and more. Here, Cynthia Graubart celebrates the bird in all its glory, southern style and beyond. This little cookbook packs <i>all </i>the know-how that cooks need to make irresistible chicken dishes for everyday and special occasions, from shopping and selecting to cutting up, frying, braising, roasting, and much more. Ranging in style from traditional southern to contemporary to international, fifty-three recipes are organized to help easily match the cut of chicken to the perfect recipe. Be assured that Graubart includes instructions for making the best fried chicken ever--seven different ways. <br><br>Graubart also brings together the chicken's culinary history with the popular culture and lore that surrounds chicken cookery in the South. She notes that the special Sunday Sabbath dinner was often built around a chicken--in fact, prior to the 1940s, chicken was sometimes more expensive than beef or pork. Today, the southern states lead the country in annual poultry production, and Kentucky Fried Chicken features throughout the American landscape.

Specializing in &#34;venereal horror&#34;, he has steadily worked his way into the mainstream, culminating in the world-wide success of &#34;The Fly&#34;. This volume traces the career of this film-maker from his early fascination with science, through his emerging cinema career, to its culmination is his adaptation of William Burroughs&#39; &#34;The Naked Lunch&#34;.</p><p>David Cronenberg is Canada's most provocative director. With internationally acclaimed films such as <i>Scanners, The Fly, Dead Ringers</i> and <i>Naked Lunch,</i> he has demonstrated his ability to touch painful nerves and invest his own unique genre with a rare philosophical and emotional intensity. In this stimulating, vivid book--combining memoir, behind-the-scenes movie stories and unsettling and original insights into the traumas of the late 20th century--David Cronenberg reveals the concerns and obsessions which dominate his rich, complex work.With films such as <i>The Brood</i> and <i>Videodrome</i>, <b>David Cronenberg</b> established himself as Canada's most provocative director. With subsequent movies such as <i>The Dead Zone</i>, <i>The Fly</i>, <i>Dead Ringers</i> and <i>Naked Lunch</i>, Cronenberg demonstrated his ability not only to touch painful nerves, but also to invest his own developing genre with seriousness, philosophical dimension and a rare emotional intensity. <br></p><h2>Sense and Sensibility (Collector&#39;s Library)</h2><p>Sense and Sensibility, the first of Jane Austen&#39;s major novels, examines the romantic lives of two very different sisters--one restrained and practical, the other wildly passionate and romantic--forced to balance their emotional needs against the harsh financial realities of the world. After their father&#39;s death leaves them impoverished, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood must struggle to win both the happiness and security they deserve. Austen trains her customary sharp eye on the hypocrisy of the age, providing a striking critique of early nineteenth-century society. The world&#39;s greatest works of literature are now available in these beautiful keepsake volumes. Bound in real cloth, and featuring gilt edges and ribbon markers, these beautifully produced books are a wonderful way to build a handsome library of classic literature. These are the essential novels that belong in every home. They&#39;ll transport readers to imaginary worlds and provide excitement, entertainment, and enlightenment for years to come. All of these novels feature attractive illustrations and have an unequalled period feel that will grace the library, the bedside table or bureau.</p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel.

Within hours everything in the dormitory suburb is surreally transformed. Vultures invade the rooftops, luxuriant tropical vegetation overruns the quiet avenues, and the local inhabitants are propelled by the young man&#39;s urgent visions through ecstatic sexual celebrations towards an apocalyptic climax.In this characteristically inventive novel Ballard displays to devastating effect the extraordinary imagination that established him as one of Britain&#39;s most highly acclaimed writers.This edition is part of a new commemorative series of Ballard&#39;s works, featuring introductions from a number of his admirers (including Ali Smith, Iain Sinclair, Martin Amis and Ned Beauman) and brand-new cover designs from the artist Stanley Donwood.</p><p>J.

Her books Full Tilt, Eight Feet in the Andes, The Waiting Land, Muddling Through in Madagascar, On a Shoestring to Coorg, Cameroon with Egbert, Transylvannia and Beyond, The Ukimwi Road, and South from the Limpopo are available from The Overlook Press.This book recounts a trip, taken mostly on bicycle, by a gritty Irishwoman in 1963. Her route was through Yugoslavia, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and ended in New Delhi. She carried a pistol, got sunstroke, and suffered the usual stomach disorders. She endured bad accommodations but reaped much local hospitality, too, including a dinner with the Pakistani president. Most of the book concerns the high mountain country of Afghanistan and Pakistan. First published in England in 1965, the book is neither current, nor quite old enough to be of much historical interest. Nonetheless, it is a spirited account, suitable for larger public library collections. Unfortunately, it lacks illustrations, and the two maps included give us little idea of the remote areas she visited. Harold M. Otness, Southern Oregon State Coll.

And, in his explorations, the Rohan Master disclosed a way of viewing and visually depicting reality (replete with familiar biblical figures, saints, angels, devils) and the emotions of simple men and women - suffering, elation, fear, melancholy, and hope - in a manner that is both original and powerfully moving.<br>From the first folio of this remarkable and often startling manuscript to the final plate, the entire range of human emotions is compassionately but uncompromisingly explored.

In <em>Among the Truthers</em>,journalist Jonathan Kay offers a thoughtful and sobering look at how socialnetworking and Web-based video sharing have engendered a flourishing of new conspiracism. Kay details the sociological profiles of tenbrands of modern conspiracists&#x2014;the Failed Historian,the Mid-Life Crack-Up, the Damaged Survivor, the Campus Revolutionary, theStoner, the Clinical Case, the Puzzle Solver, the Christian Doomsayer, the CosmicVoyager, and the Egomaniac&#x2014;in a compelling exploration of America&#x2019;s departurefrom reason and what it means for the very future of rational discourse as thenation steps further into the 21st century.</p><p><p>From left-wing 9/11 conspiracy theorists to right-wing Obama-hating "birthers"&#x2014;a sobering, eyewitness look at how America's marketplace of ideas is fracturing into a multitude of tiny, radicalized boutiques&#x2014;each peddling its own brand of paranoia</p><p>Throughout most of our nation's history, the United States has been bound together by a shared worldview. But the 9/11 terrorist attacks opened a rift in the collective national psyche: Increasingly, Americans are abandoning reality and retreating to Internet-based fantasy worlds conjured into existence out of our own fears and prejudices. </p><p>The most disturbing symptom of this trend is the 9/11 Truth movement, whose members believe that Bush administration officials engineered the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as a pretext to launch wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. But these "Truthers" are merely one segment of a vast conspiracist subculture that includes many other groups: anti-Obama extremists who believe their president is actually a foreign-born Manchurian Candidate seeking to destroy the United States from within; radical alternative-medicine advocates who claim that vaccine makers and mainstream doctors are conspiring to kill large swathes of humanity; financial neo-populists who have adapted the angry message of their nineteenth-century forebears to the age of Twitter; Holocaust deniers; fluoride phobics; obsessive Islamophobes; and more.</p><p>For two years journalist Jonathan Kay immersed himself in this dark subculture, attending conventions of conspiracy theorists, surfing their discussion boards, reading their websites, joining their Facebook groups, and interviewing them in their homes and offices.

With the eye of a connoisseur, the business acumen derived from a legendary career in international finance, and a Jeffersonian grasp of classical architecture, Richard Hampton Jenrette reveals his charming, often risky, ventures in the world of old houses. Jenrette's affinity for endangered historic sites has led to the restoration of six historic houses that he currently owns, including Edgewater on the Hudson River; Millford Plantation and Roper House, both in South Carolina; Ayr Mount in North Carolina; the Baker House in New York City; and Cane Garden in the US Virgin Islands, as well as many others that he has had a hand in restoring throughout the United States. This uniquely personal account of the quest, the acquisition, the restoration and the furnishing of each property is instructive and entertaining. Along the way, he introduces the artisans, curators, furniture specialists, designers, antiquarians, preservationists and collectors who have played a part in his Adventures with Old Houses.<p></p>This book serves as a beautiful reminder of the foresight, the vision and the dedication of one of America's most ardent collectors and a challenge to all who care about America's architectural and artistic heritage.</p><h2>The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France</h2><p>For two hundred years, the Terror has haunted the imagination of the West. The descent of the French Revolution from rapturous liberation into an orgy of apparently pointless bloodletting has been the focus of countless reflections on the often malignant nature of humanity and the folly of revolution. &nbsp;David Andress, a leading historian of the French Revolution, presents a radically different account of the Terror. In a remarkably vivid and page-turning work of history, he transports the reader from the pitched battles on the streets of Paris to the royal family's escape through secret passageways in the Tuileries palace, and across the landscape of the tragic last years of the Revolution. The violence, he shows, was a result of dogmatic and fundamentalist thinking: dreadful decisions were made by groups of people who believed they were still fighting for freedom but whose survival was threatened by famine, external war, and counter-revolutionaries within the fledging new state. Urgent questions emerge from Andress's trenchant reassessment: When is it right to arbitrarily detain those suspected of subversion? When does an earnest patriotism become the rationale for slaughter?<br>Combining startling narrative power and bold insight, <i>The Terror</i> is written with verve and exceptional pace-it is a superb popular debut from an enormously talented historian.</p><p><b>David Andress</b>, a leading historian of the French Revolution, is Principal Lecturer in Modern History at the University of Portsmouth, and is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. <i>The Terror</i> is his first book for a general readership.Excerpted from <i>The Terror</i> by David Andress.

Can terror ever be justified as an instrument of policy? These are questions which ought not to need contemporary answers, and yet they do. We have supposed repeatedly over the last two hundred years that we live in a world attuned to the benefits of liberal civilisation &#x2014; a world that ended slavery, regulated the humane conduct of warfare, created genuine democracy and held out the prospect of universal peace. A world, in short, where the almost sixty-year-old opening words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that &#x2018;all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights&#x2019;, had meaning.<br><br>Yet that same world is also the world of the tyrannies of colonial rule, of eugenic experimentation in the name of modernity, of the horrors of two world wars, and the vile perversions of Darwinist science that spawned them, of racial annihilation and a half-century-long contemplation of deliberate nuclear armageddon. The new world order that was supposed to be born from the end of Soviet Communism (itself of course originally a project to better the lot of the oppressed) now seems no more than a morass of moral ambiguity and expediency.<br><br>The dawning of this troubled modernity saw two great upheavals in the political life of nations: the French and American Revolutions. The principles that underlay both have continued to resonate down the ages &#x2014; whether the pithy &#x2018;no taxation without representation&#x2019; or the varied assertions of &#x2018;natural and imprescriptible rights of man&#x2019; to liberty, security, the pursuit of happiness and other goods. The leaders of both revolutions had a common grounding in the humanitarianism of the Age of Reason, members of a generation that across the European world was abolishing state torture, refining the process of justice away from punishment to rehabilitation, and gearing up to contest the legitimacy of slavery (though only the French tried at this point to abolish it, and that only temporarily, until Napoleon&#x2019;s more pragmatic reign).<br><br>From these common roots, the two revolutions are usually seen as diverging sharply. The Americans founded an enduring constitutional settlement on the separation of powers and the checks and balances of a federal system. The French plunged into an abyss of blood and fire, to emerge under the thumb of a military dictator crowned as emperor. The story, of course, is not actually that simple. France&#x2019;s decade of revolutionary strife was easily matched by the years of warfare in North America between the mid-1770s and mid-1780s. Of the colonies&#x2019; 2.5 million inhabitants, one in every twenty-five fled abroad, far exceeding the proportion that left France during her Revolution. A third of the adult male population of the colonies were in arms, and many of those were in semi-official militias, or simple armed bands, that preyed on civilian populations for years at a time. Military fatalities reached perhaps one in thirty-five of the entire population, with uncounted tens of thousands of other deaths from violence and unchecked disease. The crude numbers of dead in the wars and repressions of the French Revolution &#x2014; a half-million or more &#x2014; are more horrific in their scale, but, in proportion to a population more than ten times greater, little worse than the American example.<br><br>The sheer bloodiness of the American conflict is noteworthy because the rebels were trying to throw off a government that resided several thousand miles distant, and for much of the period were doing so with the active assistance of several other European powers. The French revolutionaries, by contrast, fought to overturn not merely a distant colonial power, but an entire social order, and to do so with virtually all of Europe in arms against them. What is astonishing is not so much that they tried but that, in a very real sense, they succeeded. When the French Revolution was over, the world was a very different place. The map of Europe was no longer drawn to suit the competing dynastic ambitions of ancient monarchical houses, and political debates across the continent no longer hinged on the selfish assertion of ancient privileges and prerogatives. Structures that were created by the powers of Europe explicitly to resist the threat of further revolution nonetheless were also by definition innovations, radical breaks with the past. Out of the destabilising threat of subversion from below came the &#x2018;Concert of Europe&#x2019; agreed after the fall of Napoleon, an international system that for a generation governed the politics of the continent. New creations like the kingdom of the United Netherlands came into existence as buffer-states against French revolutionary contamination, and the map of central Europe took a decisive step towards the emergence of a modern Germany.<br><br>The French Revolution&#x2019;s impact was so deep seated that simply turning the clock back had become impossible, and the more profound recognition of this was in the birth of an entire new ideology &#x2014; conservatism &#x2014; designed to prevent further upheaval without being mere futile backward-looking reaction. Just as conservatism was born in revolution, so too more directly was liberalism, the crystallisation of the concern for the rights-bearing individual citizen that had animated the initial revolutionary pronouncements of 1789. Together, these two political currents would dominate the modern world, until with the growth of the marginalised industrial working classes of the later nineteenth century socialism intruded violently to join them.<br><br>But socialism, too, was a child of the French Revolution. Intellectually, Karl Marx derived his entire picture of historical progress from liberal writers who saw in the Revolution the inevitable rise of the bourgeoisie.3 Socially and politically, the example of the Revolution&#x2019;s radical phases produced a message of ineradicable commitment to human equality that demanded action against the injustices of an industrialising world. Meanwhile nationalism, without which the history of the last 150 years is simply inconceivable, was also born in its modern forms out of the aspirations and conflicts of the revolutionary era. The modern sense of national identity, of active belonging to a national citizen-body with its associated freight of rights and duties, is as much a product of this upheaval as is the tricolour or the <i>Marseillaise</i>. On a whole host of political, intellectual and structural planes, the French Revolution is the fount and origin of our modern world.<br><br>Here, of course, lies the heart of the historical dilemma we began with, for the French Revolution about which William Wordsworth rhapsodised &#x2018;Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive&#x2019; is also the Revolution that brought the Terror to European consciousness, passing its thousands of victims beneath the modern, humane, death-dealing blade of the guillotine, turning an entire realm upside-down with paranoid pursuit of dissent and pitiless subjugation of individuals to a faceless national cause.<br><br>Many have argued that the Terror was inherent in the Revolution&#x2019;s project of innovation &#x2014; a point made by countless reactionary and Catholic polemics &#x2014; or that it was inherent in the political culture from which the Revolution itself sprang. That view is particularly prominent today, and has been since the late 1980s. In the declining years of the Cold War, and even more after the fall of the Soviet bloc, there seemed little value in earlier interpretations that put revolution at the heart of modernising change. Historical opinion instead focused on the supposedly unique and iniquitous qualities of revolutionary discourse &#x2014; on how the power of the revolutionaries to reshape language, to give new names to old things, slid into a wild and erratic intoxication of power, to the commitment to change everything, and to remould humanity in an image so purified as to become perversely meaningless, merely a justification for further purges and executions of those who did not measure up.<br><br>Along the way, it has sometimes become hard to see what the Terror actually was. In particular, it is seldom acknowledged now how far it was (much like the American Revolution) a civil war, deriving much of its grim impetus from the inevitable bitterness of conflict between former friends. Seldom, too, is it recognised just how important and active a role the enemies of the Revolution played in the aggravation of its politics &#x2014; how eagerly, for example, the king and queen of France steered the country into foreign war, with the avowed intention of using the conflict to destroy the Revolution. In all the writings on the paranoid tendencies of the revolutionaries (tendencies which are, again, well attested in the parallel American experience too),5 little attention is given to the issue of how such beliefs were given ample food by the betrayals, some real and deliberate, some clumsy and unintentional, that dogged the very heart of revolutionary politics.<br><br></p><h2>The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land</h2><p><p><strong>As seductive as <em>A Year in Provence</em> and <em>Under the Tuscan Sun</em>, but with the wit and charm of a 1930s romantic comedy, the true-life adventure of a couple who chucked New York for a new life in Tuscany.</strong></p> The M�t�'s arrived in Tuscany in the late 1980s knowing no Italian and with only four weeks to search for the country house of their dreams. On their last night there, after having been chased by wild boars and befriended by a country realtor who also sells pigs and coffins, they finally concluded the deal on the hood of a rusting tractor with the lawyer speaking Italian and them responding in French, English, and Hungarian, in a Tower of Babel version of "Who's on First?" So begins Ferenc M�t�'s endearing, in-love-with-life memoir of their first five years in Tuscany, by turns buoyant, reflective, and laugh-out-loud hilarious. His engaging, often poetic prose describes the way of life they were looking for and found-where neighbors, community, home, and, most of all, children, form the focal point of daily life. They live in a small thirteenth-century monastery, surrounded by their vineyards and olive groves, in the spectacular hills near Siena, a few miles from where <em>The English Patient</em> was filmed. <em>The Hills of Tuscany</em>--steeped in mesmerizing scenery and wonderful medieval towns, full of unforgettably delightful characters and spectacular food and wine-nourishes body, mind, and soul. If you're not passionately in love with life at the moment, you'll be hopelessly so by the time you turn the last page. Illustrated</p><p>A sensuous valentine to author Ferenc M�t�'s adopted homeland, <i>The Hills of Tuscany</i> brims with lush descriptions of golden dales, scrumptious meals, rich wines, and friendly natives. After years of nomadic roaming from Central America to Canada, M�t� (a writer) and his wife, Candace (a painter), visit Tuscany and impulsively decide that <i>this</i> is where they will settle down. A year later they return and begin the hunt for their dream house. As the likeable M�t�s (they're funny and suitably grateful for the chance to live in one of the world's garden spots) troll the countryside with a series of colorful Tuscan middlemen, it's impossible not to become emotionally involved in their quest. And when they finally discover the perfect abode--<i>La Marinaia</i>, a tastefully renovated stone farmhouse set amid scenery that Ferenc describes as "like being in the middle of a painting"--you're thrilled right along with them. Subsequent chapters follow the M�t�s' growing friendship with their neighbors, who not only help rototill the garden but also reveal where to find porcini mushrooms and truffles in the nearby woods. All in all, reading <i>The Hills of Tuscany</i> is the next best thing to quitting your job, climbing on a plane, and finding your own Tuscan dream house. <i>--Rebecca Gleason</i>FERENC MATE was born in Hungary, escaped at the age of eleven, and has lived in Budapest, Vienna, Vancouver, Laguna Beach, New York, Paris and Rome.

He investigates several kinds of birds' nests before finding one that is both empty and safely located in a tree branch. During his search he meets a pet rabbit and finds an Easter basket filled with eggs. Miller's clear and deftly executed watercolors show the pale fresh colors of a woodland spring and perfectly capture the animals, from a menacing owl to a rather bewildered-looking white rabbit. Despite occasionally awkward writing, she conveys, in a gentle way appropriate for young children, a sense of the forest animals' ongoing struggle for survival. As in her other ``Mousekin'' books (Prentice-Hall), the plot is plausible and the illustrations both beautiful and accurate. In her quiet, low-key way, Miller has created another book which should have enduring popularity.

It was a magical miniature world, with beautiful tiny porcelain dolls, furniture, even paintings and chandeliers and rugs all made to scale. But the house was enclosed in a glass case and I was never allowed to touch the family inside -- indeed, I was not even permitted to touch the glass case, for fear of leaving smudges. Dainty things had always been at peril in my large hands, and the dollhouse was for me to admire but never to touch.<br><br>I kept it on an oak table under the sash of stained glass windows in my bedroom. The sun coming through the tinted windows always spread a soft, rainbow colored sky over the tiny universe and put the light of happiness into the faces of the miniature family. Even the servants in the kitchen, the butler dressed in white livery who stood near the entrance door, and the nanny in the nursery all wore looks of contentment.<br><br>That was as it should be, as it should always be -- as I fervently hoped and prayed it would be for me someday. That miniature world was without shadows; for, even on overcast days, when clouds hung their gloom outside, the tinted-glass windows magically turned the gray light into rainbows.<br><br>The real world, my own world, seemed always to be gray, without rainbows. Gray for my eyes, which I had always been told were too stern, gray for my hopes, gray for the old maid no one wanted in the deck of cards. At twenty-four, I was an old maid, already a spinster. It seemed I intimidated eligible young men with my height and intelligence. It seemed that the rainbow world of love and marriage and babies would always be as closed off to me as that dollhouse I so admired. For it was only in make-believe that my hopes took wing.<br><br>In my fantasies I was pretty, lighthearted, charming, like the other young women I had met but never befriended. Mine was a lonely life, filled mostly with books and dreams. And though I did not talk about it, I clung to the small hope my dear mother had given me just before she died.<br><br>"Life is very much like a garden, Olivia. And people are like tiny seeds, nurtured by love and friendship and caring. And if enough time and care are spent, they bloom into gorgeous flowers. And sometimes, even an old, neglected plant left in a yard gone to seed will unexpectedly burst into blossom. These are the most precious, the most cherished blossoms of all. You will be that sort of flower, Olivia. It may take time, but your flowering will come."<br><br>How I missed my optimistic mother. I was sixteen when she died -- just when I most needed to have those woman-to-woman talks with her that would tell me how<br>to win a man's heart, how to be like her: respectable, competent, yet a woman in every way. My mother was forever involved in one thing or another, and in everything she was competent and in charge. She threaded her way through each crisis, and when one ended, there was always another to replace it. My father seemed content that she was busy. It mattered not with what.<br><br>He often said that just because women weren't involved in serious business, that didn't mean they should be idle. They had their "womanly" things to do.<br><br>Yet, when it came to me, he encouraged me to go to business school. It seemed right and proper that I would become his private accountant, that he would give me a place in his den, a manly room with one wall covered with firearms and another with pictures from his hunting and fishing expeditions, a room that always had the odor of cigar smoke and whiskey, its dark brown rug the most worn-looking of any rug in the house. He set aside a portion of his large black oakwood desk for me to work meticulously on his accounts, his business expenses, his employees' wages, and even his household expenses. Working with my father, I often felt more like the son he had always longed for -- but never got -- than the daughter I was. Oh, I did want to please, but it seemed I would never be just what anyone wanted.<br><br>He used to say I would be a great help to any husband, and I used to believe that was why he was so determined I would get a business education and have that experience. He didn't come out and say it in so many words, but I could hear them anyway -- a woman six feet tall needed something more to capture a man's love.<br><br>Yes, I was six feet tall; I had shot up as a teenager, much to my dismay, to giant proportions. I was the beanstalk in Jack's garden. I was the giant. There was nothing dainty or fragile about me.<br><br>I had my mother's auburn hair, but my shoulders were too wide and my bosom large. I often stood before my mirror and wished my arms shorter. My gray eyes were too long and catlike and my nose was too sharp. My lips were thin, my complexion pale and gray. Gray, gray, gray. How I longed to be pretty and bright. But when I sat before my vanilla marble vanity table trying to blush and to flutter my eyelashes -- look flirtatious -- I managed only to look a fool. I didn't want to look empty-headed and silly, yet I couldn't help but sit before the glass-encased dollhouse and study the pretty, delicate porcelain face of the tiny wife. How I wished it were my face. Maybe then this would be my world.<br><br>But it was not.<br><br>And so I left my hope encased with the porcelain figures and went about my way.<br><br>If my father had really expected to make me more attractive to a man by providing me with an education and practical business experience, he must have been sorely disappointed in the result. Gentlemen came and went, all coming because of his manipulations, I discovered; and still I was yet to be courted and loved. I was always afraid that my money, my father's money, money I would inherit, would bring a man to the door pretending to be in love with me. I think my father feared the same thing, because he came to me one day and said, "I have written into my will that whatever money you receive shall be only yours and yours to do with what you like. No husband will ever expect to take control of your fortune simply by marrying you."<br><br>He made his announcement and left before I could even respond. Then he screened any candidates for my romance carefully, exposing me only to the highest class of gentleman, men of some fortune themselves. I had yet to meet one I didn't tower over, or one who wouldn't scowl at the things I said. It seemed I'd die a spinster.<br><br>But my father wouldn't have it so.<br><br>"There's a young man coming to dinner tonight," he began one Friday morning late in April, "who I must say is one of the most impressive I've met. I want you to wear that blue dress you had made for yourself last Easter."<br><br>"Oh, Father." It was on the tip of my tongue to say, "Why bother," but he anticipated my reaction.<br><br>"Don't argue about it, and for heaven's sake don't start in on the woman suffrage movement when we're at the table."<br><br>My eyes flamed. He knew how I hated to be bridled like one of his horses.<br><br>"A man no sooner shows some interest in you than you challenge the most treasured of manly privileges. It never fails. The blue dress," he repeated, and pivoted and left before I could offer an argument.<br><br>It seemed pointless to me to go through the rituals at my vanity table. I shampooed my hair vigorously and then sat down to brush it a hundred times, softening it and pinning it back neatly but not too harsh with the ivory combs my father had given me for Christmas the previous year.<br><br>My father didn't know or even seem to recognize that I had commissioned the "blue dress" because I wanted a dress that looked like the dresses women wore in fashion photographs. The bodice was low enough to expose some of the fullness of my bosom, and the tight waist gave me a suggestion of an "hourglass" figure. It was made of silk, and the material was exceptionally soft and had a sheen to it like nothing else I owned. The sleeves were cut just above the elbow. I thought that made my arms look shorter.<br><br>I put on my mother's blue sapphire pendant, which I thought made my neck look slimmer. There was a blush in my cheeks but I couldn't say if it was there because of my healthy body or because of my nervousness. I was nervous. I'd been through enough of those evenings before -- watching the man's face fall as he rose to greet me and I towered over him.<br><br>I was merely rehearsing for another failure.<br><br>By the time I went downstairs, my father's guest had arrived. They were together in the den. I heard my father's loud laughter, and then I heard the gentleman's voice, low but deeply resonant, the voice of a man with some confidence. I pressed my palms against my hips to dry off the wetness and proceeded to the doorway of the den.<br><br>The moment I appeared, Malcolm Neal Foxworth stood up and my heart skipped a beat. He was at least six foot two and easily the most handsome young man who had ever come to our house.<br><br>"Malcolm," my father said, "I'm proud to present my lovely daughter."<br><br>He took my hand and said, "Charmed, Miss Winfield."<br><br>I was looking directly into his sky-blue eyes. And he was gazing just as forthrightly into mine. I'd never believed in schoolgirl romantic notions such as love at first sight, but I felt his gaze slide right over my heart and lodge in the pit of my stomach.<br><br>He had flaxen blond hair, a little longer in the back than most men wore, but the strands were brushed neatly and looked heavenly light. He had a strong Roman nose and a thin straight mouth. Broad shouldered, slim-hipped, he had an almost athletic air about him. And I could tell by the way he was gazing at me, with almost a wry smile of amusement, that he was quite accustomed to women falling into a flutter about him. Well, I thought, I mustn't give him something more to be amused at Olivia Winfield. Of course, such a man would hardly give me the time of day, and I would have to get through another evening of Father's doomed matchmaking. I shook his hand firmly, smiled back, and quickly looked away.<br><br>After we were introduced, my father explained that Malcolm had come to New London from Yale, where he had attended a class reunion. He was interested in investing in the shipbuilding industry because he believed that with the Great War over, the markets for exporting would develop. From what I learned of his background that night, I understood that he already owned a number of cloth factories, had commanding interest in a few banks, and owned some lumber mills in Virginia. He was in business with his father, but his father, even though he was only fifty-five, was distracted. I didn't learn until later what that meant.<br><br>At dinner I tried to be the polite, quiet observer that my father wanted me to be, the way my mother used to be. Margaret and Philip, our servants, served an elegant dinner of beef Wellington, a menu my father had chosen himself. He did so only on special occasions. I thought my father was being quite obvious when he said, "Olivia's a college graduate, you know. She has a business degree and handles a major portion of my bookkeeping."<br><br>"Really?" Malcolm seemed genuinely impressed. His cerulean blue eyes brightened even more with interest and I felt he was taking a second, more serious look at me. "Do you enjoy the work, Miss Winfield?"<br><br>I shot a glance at my father, who sat back in his high-backed light-maple chair and nodded as if prompting my responses. I did so want this Malcolm Foxworth to like me, but I was determined to be who I was.<br><br>"It's better to fill your time with sensible and productive things," I said. "Even for a woman."<br><br>My father's smile faded, but Malcolm's widened. "I totally agree," he said. He didn't turn back to my father. "I find most so-called beautiful women vapid and rather silly. It's as if their good looks are enough to see them through life. I prefer intelligent women who know how to think for themselves, women who can be real assets to their husbands."<br><br>My father cleared his throat. "Yes, yes," he said, and turned the conversation back to the shipping industry. He had it from good sources that the merchant marine fleet, built for the war effort, would soon be offered to private owners. His topic took Malcolm's attention for most of the dinner, but nevertheless, I felt Malcolm's eyes on me and at times, when I looked up at him, he was smiling at me.<br><br>Never had I sat with one of my father's guests and been so enraptured. Never had I felt as welcome at the table. Malcolm was polite to my father, but it was clear to me that he wanted to talk more to me.<br><br>To me!<br><br>The handsomest man ever to come to our house was interested in me? But he could have a hundred beautiful girls to adore him forever. Why should he be interested in a Plain Jane such as I? But oh how I wanted to believe I wasn't imagining all those side glances, those times he asked me to pass him things he could have easily gotten himself, the way he tried to bring me into the conversation. Perhaps, just for a few hours I could allow my slight bud of hope to blossom. Just for tonight! Tomorrow I'd let it gray again.<br><br>After dinner Malcolm and my father adjourned to the den to smoke their cigars and talk more about the investments Malcolm wanted to make. With them my hopes, so briefly flowered, so quickly withered. Of course Malcolm wasn't interested in me -- he was interested in business with my father. They would be in there for the rest of the evening. I might as well retire to my room to read that new novel that was attracting attention, Edith Wharton's <i>Age of Innocence.</i> But I decided instead to bring the book down to the sitting room and read by the Tiffany lamp, happy to see Malcolm just to say good-bye.<br><br>It was very quiet on our street that time of evening, but I looked up to see a couple walking arm in arm. It was the way the husband and wife in my glass-encased doll world would walk if they could escape their imprisonment, I thought. I watched them until they disappeared around the corner. How I wished I could someday walk with a man like that -- a man like Malcolm. But it was not to be. It seemed God was deaf to my hopes and prayers for love. I sighed. As I turned back to my book, I realized all I could know of love and life would be from books.<br><br>Then I spied Malcolm in the doorway. Why, he had been watching me! He stood so straight and still, his shoulders drawn back, his head high. There was a calculating look in his eyes, as if he were sizing me up unawares, but I didn't know what to make of it.<br><br>"Oh!" My surprise brought heat to my cheeks. My heart began to thump so loudly, I thought he might even hear it across the room.<br><br>"It is a lovely evening," he said. "Could I interest you in a walk?"<br><br>For a moment I just stared. He wanted to take me out walking!<br><br>"Yes," I said. I could see he liked the way I came to a quick decision. I didn't try to flutter my eyelashes or act uncertain to tease him with my answer. I wanted to go for a walk and I wanted very much to go for a walk with <i>him.</i> If I had a hope that wha...</p><h2>Nedjma, a Novel (Caribbean and African Literature)</h2><p><p>Nedjma is a masterpiece of North African writing. Its intricate plot involves four men in love with the beautiful woman whose name serves as the title of the novel. Nedjma is the central figure of this disorienting novel, but more than the unfortunate wife of a man she does not love, more than the unwilling cause of rivalry among many suitors, Nedjma is the symbol of Algeria. Kateb has crafted a novel that is the saga of the founding ancestors of Algeria through the conquest of Numidia by the Romans, the expansion of the Ottoman Empire, and French colonial conquest. Nedjma is symbolic of the rich and sometimes bloody past of Algeria, of its passions, of its tenderness; it is the epic story of a human quest for freedom and happiness.</p></p><p><p>Kateb Yacine (1929-89) recieved many literary distinctions including the Prix Jean Amrouche.

Whaling ships full of men, stranded in ice. Follow three rescuers in a race against time &#x2014; and all odds &#x2014; in this heartpounding true adventure.</b><br><br>In 1897, whaling in the Arctic waters off Alaska&#x2019;s coast was as dangerous as it was lucrative. And in that particular year, winter blasted early, bringing storms and ice packs that caught eight American whale ships and three hundred sailors off guard. Their ships locked in ice, with no means of escape, the whalers had limited provisions on board, and little hope of surviving until warmer temperatures arrived many months later. Here is the incredible story of three men sent by President McKinley to rescue them. The mission? A perilous trek over 1,500 miles of nearly impassable Alaskan terrain, in the bone-chilling months of winter, to secure two herds of reindeer (for food) and find a way to guide them to the whalers before they starve. With the help of photographs and journal entries by one of the rescuers, Martin W. Sandler takes us on every step of their riveting journey, facing raging blizzards, killing cold, injured sled dogs, and setbacks to test the strongest of wills.<br>Back matter includes an epilogue, further information, a time line, source notes, a bibliography, and an index.</p><p><b>Martin W. Sandler</b> has written more than seventy books for children and adults and has written and produced seven television series. He has twice been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and has won multiple Emmy Awards. He lives in Massachusetts.Gr 5 Up-Endurance. Fortitude. Bravery. Any of these words could easily describe the people involved in this amazing, but little-known rescue-adventure. The year was 1897 and whaling was big business in America. Whaleship captains hunting in the Arctic Circle, pushing for more whales and the profits they meant, ended up stranded by the ice pack, affecting eight ships and their crews. One ship managed to escape the danger and alert the U.S. government to the predicament, thus setting in motion a nearly "impossible rescue." A few daring men with the experience and willingness to tackle such a mission quickly gathered their supplies and courage and headed north to bring food in the form of herded reindeer and help to some 300 sailors stuck in the Arctic winter. Using extensive primary sources in the form of journals, reports, letters, and photographs, Sandler has pieced together a stirring and evocative retelling of this historical adventure. The writing draws readers into both the suspense of reaching the struggling whalers in time as well as the dire, life-threatening conditions that the rescuers themselves faced. Archival black-and-white photographs taken during the journey help pull the whole story together and prove an excellent visual accompaniment to the unfolding drama. An epilogue answers many of the "what happened after..." questions, and extensive source notes round out the back matter. For readers who prefer their drama to be true, suggest this title along with Jennifer Armstrong's Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World (Crown, 1998), Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air (Villard, 1997), and Dolores Johnson's Onward: a Photobiography of African-American Polar Explorer Matthew Henson (National Geographic, 2005).-Jody Kopple, Shady Hill School, Cambridge, MA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Maurice Herzog led an expedition of French climbers to the summit of this 26,000-foot Himalayan peak in 1950. At the time of the assault, it was the highest mountain ever climbed, a remarkable feat in itself made all the more remarkable by the fact that it had never previously been charted. Herzog and his team not only had to climb the darn thing, they had to find the route. As riveting as the tale of the ascent remains nearly half a century later, the story of the descent through virtually unsurvivable--think avalanche and frostbite, for starters--conditions is unforgettable. Herzog&#39;s masterful account, finally back in print, is a monument of courage and spirit, an epic adventure excitingly told.In 1950, no mountain higher than 8,000 meters had ever been climbed. Maurice Herzog and other members of the French Alpine Club had resolved to try. Their goal was a 26,493-foot Himalayan peak called Annapurna. But unlike other climbs, which draw on the experience of prior reconnaissance, the routes up Annapurna had never been analyzed before. Herzog and his team had to locate the mountain using sketchy, crude maps, pick out a single, untried route, and go for the summit. Annapurna is the unforgettable account of this dramatic and heroic climb, and of its harrowing aftermath. Although Herzog and his comrade Louis Lachenal reached the mountain's summit, their descent was a nightmare of frostbite, snow blindness, and near death. With grit and courage manifest on every page, Herzog's narrative is one of the great mountain-adventure stories of all time.

In Revelation, Sansom&#39;s newest book in the series, the year is 1543 and King Henry VIII is wooing Lady Catherine Parr, a woman sympathetic to reform, whom he wants for his sixth wife- much to the dismay of Archbishop Cranmer and the embattled Protestant faction at court. Meanwhile, Matthew Shardlake is working to defend a teenage boy, a religious fanatic who is being held in the infamous Bedlam hospital for the insane. When an old friend of Shardlake&#39;s is murdered, he vows to bring the killer to justice. His search leads him back to Bedlam but also to Catherine Parr-and the dark prophecies of the Book of Revelation. As Bishop Bonner prepares to purge London of Protestants, Shardlake, with his assistant Jack Barak, uncovers a series of horrific murders that shake them all to the core.

Sansom</b>, the internationally bestselling author ofthe novels<i>Winter in Madrid</i>and<i>Dominion</i>andthe Matthew Shardlake Tudor Mystery series,earned a Ph.D. in history and was a lawyer before becoming a full-time writer.</p>The high chandeliers in the Great Hall of Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn were ablaze with candles, for it was late afternoon when the play began. Most members of Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn were present, the barristers in their robes and their wives in their best costumes. After an hour standing watching, my back was starting to ache, and I envied the few elderly and infirm members who had brought stools.<br><br>The performance of a play at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, traditionally held in March, had been cancelled earlier in the month because of heavy snow; late in the month now, it was still unseasonably cold, the breath of actors and audience visible, wafting up like smoke to the high roofbeams. The play that year was a new Interlude, <i>The Trial of Treasure</i>, a heavy-handed moral fable with the gorgeously robed actors portraying the vices and virtues of mankind. As the actor playing Virtue, resplendent in pale robes and a long, white, false beard, lectured Dissimulation on his deceitful ways &#x2014; appropriately, perhaps, to an audience of lawyers &#x2014; my attention wandered. I cast my eyes over the shadowed faces of the audience. Treasurer Rowland, a thin-faced, acerbic old man, was eyeing the actors as though wondering whether it might have been better hiring a troupe with less expensive costumes even if this play required no elaborate scenery. Across from me I saw my old enemy Stephen Bealknap, his greedy pale blue eyes studying his fellow lawyers. Those eyes were never still, would never meet yours, and as he saw me looking at him his gaze slid away. He was perhaps the crookedest lawyer I had ever come across; it still smarted that eighteen months before I had been forced to abandon a case against him through the ruthless machinations of his patron, Richard Rich. It struck me that he looked tired, ill.<br><br>Some distance away my friend Roger Elliard, to whose house I was invited to a dinner afterwards, held his wife&#x2019;s hand. A new scene had begun; Lust had made a pact of fellowship with Inclination To Evil. Embracing him, Lust was suddenly seized with pain and crouched on his knees.<br><br>Out alas, what sudden passion is this,<br>I am so taken that I cannot stand,<br>the cramp, the cramp has touched me,<br>I shall die without remedy now out of hand.<br><br>The actor, struck down by divine judgement, stretched out a trembling hand to the audience. I saw Bealknap look at him with a sort of puzzled contempt; Roger, though, turned suddenly away. I knew why; I would talk to him later.<br><br>At last the play ended; the players bowed, the audience clapped, and we got our cold limbs into motion and stepped out into Gatehouse Court. The sun was just setting, illuminating the redbrick buildings and the melting snow in the courtyard with an umber light. People walked away to the gate, or if they lived at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn stepped homewards, wrapping their coats around them. I waited in the doorway for the Elliards, nodding to acquaintances. The audience were the only ones abroad, for it was a Saturday out of law term, Palm Sunday Eve. I looked across to the Elliards&#x2019; lodgings. All the windows were lit and servants could be seen within, bustling with trays. Dorothy&#x2019;s dinners were well known around the Inn, and even at the end of Lent, with red meat forbidden, I knew that she would have large tabling and good belly cheer for the group they had invited.<br><br>Despite the cold I felt relaxed, more peaceful than I had for a long time. In just over a week it would be Easter Sunday, and also the twenty-fifth of March, the official start of the New Year of 1543. Sometimes in recent years I had wondered at this time what grim events the coming year might bring. But I reflected that now I had only good and interesting work, and times with good friends, to look forward to. That morning while dressing I had paused to study my face in the steel mirror in my bedroom; something I seldom did, for the sight of my humped back still distressed me. I saw streaks of grey in my hair, deepening lines on my face. Yet I thought perhaps they gave me something of a distinguished look; and I had passed forty the previous year, I could no longer expect to look young.<br><br>That afternoon, before the performance, I had walked down to the Thames, for I had heard the ice was breaking up at last after the long, bitter winter. I stood at Temple Stairs and looked down at the river. True enough, huge chunks of ice tumbled against each other with great crashes and creaks amid roiling grey waters. I walked back through soft, melting snow, thinking that perhaps spring was coming at last.<br><br>Standing in the doorway of the Hall, I shivered suddenly despite my heavy fur-lined coat, for though the air was definitely warmer today it was still chill and I had never put back the flesh I lost in my bad fever eighteen months before. I jumped slightly as someone clapped me on the shoulder. It was Roger, his slim form swathed in a heavy coat. Beside him his wife Dorothy, her plump cheeks red with cold, smiled at me. Her brown hair was gathered under a round French hood set with pearls.<br><br>&#x2018;You were in a brown study, Matthew,&#x2019; Roger said. &#x2018;Reflecting on the high moral sentiments of the play?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;High as a house but heavy as a horse,&#x2019; Dorothy said.<br><br>&#x2018;That they were,&#x2019; I agreed. &#x2018;Who chose it?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;The Treasurer.&#x2019; Roger looked to where Rowland was talking to an ancient judge, nodding his head gravely. Roger lowered his voice. &#x2018;He wanted something that wasn&#x2019;t politically contentious. Wise in these days. But an Italian comedy would have been better.&#x2019;<br><br>We walked across the courtyard together. I noticed the snow on the Gatehouse Court fountain, which had been frozen this last three months, was almost gone, revealing patches of grey ice. Soon perhaps the fountain would be working again, its gentle plashing sounding across the court. A few coins were exposed on the ice; even with the fountain frozen people still threw money in with a prayer for victory in a case or luck in an affair of the heart; for though they might deny it, lawyers were as superstitious as other men.<br>Roger&#x2019;s steward, an old man called Elias who had been with the family for years, greeted us at the door and took me upstairs to wash my hands. Then I went into the parlour, where fat candles cast a warm buttery light on the chairs and cushions. A dozen guests, all barristers and their wives, already sat or lounged, served with wine by Elias and a boy. A roaring fire warmed the room, bringing sweet smells from the scented herbs on the wooden floor, its light glinting on the silverware on the cloth-covered table. The walls were decorated with framed portraits in the new fashion, mostly of biblical characters. Above the large fireplace stood one of the best pieces of furniture in Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, Roger&#x2019;s pride and joy. It was a large, carved wooden frieze of intricate design, the branches of trees in full leaf interlaced with flowers and fruits, the heads of animals peering through, deer and boar and even a unicorn. Roger stood beside it, talking to Ambrose Loder from my chambers. His slim form was animated, his fine hands waving as he made some point to the plump barrister, who stood immobile, a sceptical look on his red face.<br><br>Dorothy stood beside him, wearing an expression of good-natured amusement, her colourful clothes a contrast to the black robes of the two lawyers. She wore a green damask dress with gold piping down the front, and a high collar open at the throat; it suited her well. Seeing me, she excused herself and came across.<br><br>I had known Dorothy near twenty years. She was the daughter of a serjeant in my first chambers. We had both been in our early twenties then and I had at once been attracted to Dorothy&#x2019;s elegance, wit and kind nature &#x2014; a rare combination. She seemed to like my company too, never seemed to mind my bent back, and we became good friends. After a while I dared to think of trying to turn friendship into something more. I had given no signs of my real feelings, though, and therefore had only myself to blame when I learned that Roger, my friend and colleague, had already proposed marriage and been accepted. He later said &#x2014; and I believed him &#x2014; that he had not realized my feelings for Dorothy. She had guessed, though, and tried to sweeten the pill by saying she had had a difficult choice to make. I had found that hard to believe, for Roger was handsome as well as clever, with a quicksilver, energetic grace to his movements.<br><br>Dorothy was, like me, past forty now; though apart from little wrinkles visible around her eyes she looked a good deal younger. I bent and kissed her on her full cheeks.<br><br>&#x2018;A merry Palm Sunday to you, Dorothy.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And to you, Matthew.&#x2019; She squeezed my hand. &#x2018;How is your health?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Good these days.&#x2019; My back had often given me trouble, but these last months I had been conscientious in the exercises my physician friend Guy had prescribed, and had felt much better.<br><br>&#x2018;You look well.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And you look younger each New Year, Dorothy. May this one bring peace and prosperity.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I hope so. Though there has been a strange portent, have you heard? Two huge fish washed up by the Thames. Great grey things half the size of a house. They must have been under the ice.&#x2019; The twinkle in her eyes told me she found the story, like so much in the world, delightfully absurd.<br><br>&#x2018;Were they alive?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No. They lie on the mudbanks over at Greenwich. People have been crossing London Bridge in hundreds to see them. Everyone says that coming the day before Palm Sunday it portends some terrible happening.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;People are always finding portents these days. It is a passion now among the busy Bible-men of London.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;True.&#x2019; She gave me a searching look, perhaps catching a bitter note in my reply. Twenty years ago Dorothy and Roger and I had all been reformers, hoping for a new Christian fellowship in the world. They still did. But though many of their guests had also been reformers in the early days, most had now retreated to a quiet professional life, frightened and disillusioned by the tides of religious conflict and repression that had flowed ever higher in the decade since the King&#x2019;s break with Rome. I wondered if Dorothy guessed that, for me, faith was almost gone.<br><br>She changed the subject. &#x2018;For us at least the news has been good. We had a letter from Samuel today. The roads to Bristol must be open again.&#x2019; She raised her dark eyebrows. &#x2018;And reading between the lines, I think he has a girl.&#x2019;<br><br>Samuel was Roger and Dorothy&#x2019;s only child, the apple of their eye. Some years before, the family had moved to Bristol, Roger&#x2019;s home town, where he had obtained the post of City Recorder. He had returned to practise at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn a year before, but Samuel, now eighteen and apprenticed to a cloth merchant, had decided to stay behind; to the sorrow of both his parents, I knew.<br><br>I smiled gently. &#x2018;Are you sure you are not reading your wishes into his letter?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No, he mentions a name. Elizabeth. A merchant&#x2019;s daughter.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;He will not be able to marry till after his apprenticeship.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Good. That will allow time to see if they are suited.&#x2019; She smiled roguishly. &#x2018;And perhaps for me to send some spy to Bristol. Your assistant Barak, perhaps. I hear he is good at such jobs.&#x2019;<br><br>I laughed. &#x2018;Barak is busy with my work. You must find another spy.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I like that sharp humour of his. Does he well?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;He and his wife lost a child last year. It hit him hard, though he does not show it.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And she?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I have not seen Tamasin. I keep meaning to call on them at home. I must do it. She was kind to me when I had my fever.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;The Court of Requests keeps you busy, then. And a serjeant. I always knew you would reach that eminence one day.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Ay.&#x2019; I smiled. &#x2018;And it is good work.&#x2019; It was over a year now since Archbishop Cranmer had nominated me as one of the two barristers appointed to plead before the Court of Requests where poor men&#x2019;s pleas were heard. A serjeancy, the status of a senior barrister, had come with the post.<br><br>&#x2018;I have never enjoyed my work so much,&#x2019; I continued. &#x2018;Though the caseload is large and some of the clients &#x2014; well, poverty does not make men good, or easy.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Nor should it,&#x2019; Dorothy replied vigorously. &#x2018;It is a curse.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I do not complain. The work is varied.&#x2019; I paused. &#x2018;I have a new case, a boy who has been put in the Bedlam. I am meeting with his parents tomorrow.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;On Palm Sunday?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;There is some urgency.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A mad client.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Whether he is truly mad or not is the issue. He was put there on the Privy Council&#x2019;s orders. It is one of the strangest matters I have ever come across. Interesting, though I wish I did not have to tangle with a Council matter.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You will see justice done, that I do not doubt.&#x2019; She laid her hand on my arm.<br><br>&#x2018;Matthew!&#x2019; Roger had appeared beside me. He shook my hand vigorously. He was small and wiry, with a thin but well-favoured face, searching blue eyes and black hair starting to recede. He was as full of energy as ever. Despite his winning of Dorothy all those years before, I still had the strongest affection for him.<br><br>&#x2018;I hear Samuel has written,&#x2019; I said.<br><br>&#x2018;Ay, the imp. At last!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I must go to the kitchen,&#x2019; Dorothy said. &#x2018;I will see you shortly, Matthew. Talk to Roger, he has had an interesting idea.&#x2019;<br><br>I bowed as she left, then turned back to Roger.<br><br>&#x2018;How have you been?&#x2019; I asked quietly.<br><br>He lowered his voice. &#x2018;It has not come on me again. But I will be glad when I have seen your doctor friend.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I saw you look away when Lust was suddenly struck down during the play.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Ay. It frightens me, Matthew.&#x2019; Suddenly he looked vulnerable, like a little boy. I pressed his arm.<br><br>In recent weeks Roger had several times unexpectedly lost his balance and fallen over, for no apparent reason. He feared he was developing the falling sickness, that terrible affliction where a man or woman, quite healthy in other ways, will periodically collapse on the ground, out of their senses, writhing and grunting. The illness, which was untreatable, was regarded by some as a kind of temporary madness and by others as evidence of possession by an evil spirit. The fact that spectacular symptoms could erupt at any moment meant people avoided sufferers.

As the text briefly describes the tiny insect's physical and behavioral characteristics, natural habitats, life cycle, diet, and enemies, it suggests that one imagine becoming an ant, taking on specific physical characteristics as they are mentioned and performing some of a worker ant's tasks. Vibrant paintings?most of which are two-page spreads?show a variety of ant species in natural settings as they engage in food gathering, fighting off enemies, tending larvae or the queen, etc. An appendix identifies the species depicted by common name. While the lilting, clearly written text is well organized, some useful information is omitted. For instance, terms such as "larvae," "cocoon," and "pupae" are not defined. Aphids are mentioned, but not identified as insects and no explanation is given as to how ants "sip honeydew" from them. Also, the environments shown are too pristine to be completely realistic. Arthur Dorros's Ant Cities (HarperCollins, 1988) provides more detailed information of life within an ant colony, but lacks Brenner's imaginative approach to the subject and Schwartz's anatomically precise paintings. Minor flaws aside, Thinking About Ants will give young readers a good idea of what an ant's life is really like.?Karey Wehner, San Francisco Public Library<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 2-3, younger for reading aloud. Brenner invites readers to get down--way down--and take a close look at ants: their colors, bodies, diet, natural enemies, colonies, and reproductive cycle. Schwartz makes the mental foray easy with a set of crisply drafted close-up paintings that somehow avoid being frightening--even when depicting a full-page view of an insect head or soldier ants ripping interlopers into fragments. The author breaks her easy narrative into short, occasionally rhyming sentences or phrases, framing many as questions; the text and large, clear pictures combine to make this an unusually promising candidate for a read-aloud science book. Children sharp enough to ask what kinds of ants they're seeing here will find the 11 varieties indexed at the end, and for more detail about ant lives and habits, follow this up with Arthur Dorros' <i>Ant Cities</i> (1987). <i>John Peters</i></p><h2>Le Livre d&#39;or l&#39;anniversaire d&#39;Asterix et Obelix (French Edition)</h2><p>Product Dimensions: 8.9 x 0.4 x 11.6 inches Shipping Weight: 0.8 LB</p><p></p><h2>The Threat (Christian Heritage Series: The Charleston Years #3)</h2><p>In 1861, eleven-year-old Austin travels with his family from their South Carolina plantation to their North Carolina vacation home where he uncovers a plot against his uncle who opposes secession</p><p>With a passion for children of all ages, <b>Nancy Rue</b> has a unique ability to tell a story that captures a child's imagination.

Eleven-year-old Austin Hutchinson, his mother, and his younger brother have come down from the North to stay with relatives while their mother recuperates from an unknown illness. Since Austin and his family are outright abolitionists, their presence on the Canaan Grove plantation brings trouble for Uncle Drayton Ravenal. Austin causes more trouble by befriending Henry-James, a young slave on the plantation. In The Threat, Austin runs across bullies who threaten to beat him up for wearing an American flag pin. In The Trap, Narvel Guthrie plays nasty and dangerous tricks on Austin and Henry-James. In each of the stories, Austin uses his "book smarts" to triumph over the bad guys. The stories relay interesting information about daily plantation life. The stories explore the feelings of both Northerners and Southerners toward slavery and the prospect of war. However, the dominant Christian theme is excessive and detracts from the plot. Additionally, readers may find the Southern dialect hard to comprehend.

Kurland leads off with "The Traveller," a humorous time travel piece that tosses a modern-day woman back into the life of a 13th-century knight who needs to reclaim his inheritance.

"The Bachelor Knight," Deborah Simmons's story of a valiant but lowly born knight who is forced to honor an old vow and marry a lady so that she can retain her holdings, and Glynnis Campbell's "The Siege," a romantic tale of a knight and his reluctant intended, unaware of the other's identity and trapped together during an assault on her family's castle, nicely round out the collection.

Daniel A. Lord, S.J., offers a collection of sixteen deeply personal letters written to Christ as Lord was dying of cancer. Known as "the Hollywood priest" because of his involvement in the film industry, Lord was the author of ninety books and almost three hundred pamphlets. First published in 1963 and now back in print, these letters are still a shining example of an intimate relationship with Christ and a model of how to talk with God in an honest and intimate way.<br><br>In 1954, Fr. Daniel Lord made his annual Ignatian retreat while being treated in a St. Louis Hospital. On the second day of his eight-day retreat, Lord learned that his lung cancer would leave him with only a short time to live.

Thomas Gavin, S.J., readers would never know of it.<br><br>Following the path of the Spiritual Exercises, Lord eloquently expresses gratitude and praise; acknowledges his complete dependence on God; confesses the constant repetition of the same boring sins; and reflects on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. But this is no ordinary retreat companion. Lord's originality and lively imagination shine through as he reflects on the beauty of a hyacinth, compares himself to a goldfish in a bowl, and pictures the scene of himself standing before God in judgment.<br><br>This new edition includes a foreword by Michael Rossmann, S.J., editor of the Jesuit Post, and an introduction to Fr.

It shows up not just between political parties and ethnic groups and churches but also inside of them. As Christians, we&#x2019;ve felt pushed to the outskirts of national public life, yet even then we are divided about how to respond. Some want to strengthen the evangelical voting bloc. Others focus on social-justice causes, and still others would abandon the public square altogether. What do we do when brothers and sisters in Christ sit next to each other in the pews but feel divided and angry? Is there a way forward?</p><p>In <em>How the Nations Rage</em>, political theology scholar and pastor Jonathan Leeman challenges Christians from across the spectrum to hit the restart button. First, we shift our focus from redeeming the nation to living as a redeemed nation. Second, we take the lessons learned inside the church into our public engagement outside of it by loving our neighbors and seeking justice. When we identify with Christ more than a political party or social grouping, we avoid the false allure of building heaven on earth and return to the church&#x2019;s unchanging political task: to represent a heavenly and future kingdom now. It&#x2019;s only when we realize that the life of our churches <em>now</em> is the hope of the nation for tomorrow that we become the salt and light Jesus calls us to be.</p></p><p><p>Jonathan Leeman is the editorial director at 9Marks, a ministry that helps church leaders build healthy churches.

As a child, she discovered that a trip to the local bookmobile with her sisters was more exhilarating than a ride at the carnival. Books were the glue that held her immigrant family together. When Nina's eldest sister died at the age of forty-six, Nina turned to books for comfort, escape, and introspection. In her beloved purple chair, she rediscovered the magic of such writers as Toni Morrison, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ian McEwan, Edith Wharton, and, of course, Leo Tolstoy. Through the connections Nina made with books and authors (and even other readers), her life changed profoundly, and in unexpected ways. Reading, it turns out, can be the ultimate therapy. </p><p><em>Tolstoy and the Purple Chair</em> also tells the story of the Sankovitch family: Nina's father, who barely escaped death in Belarus during World War II; her four rambunctious children, who offer up their own book recommendations while helping out with the cooking and cleaning; and Anne-Marie, her oldest sister and idol, with whom Nina shared the pleasure of books, even in her last moments of life.

And <i>David</i> offers an insightful perspective on what it means to be truly spiritual, to become like David�&#x20ac;�men and women after God's own heart.</p> <p><i>David </i>is the first of a multi-volume series exploring great lives from the Bible. Chuck Swindoll wants to show us that these men and women became great when they placed themselves at the Lord's disposal, allowing Him to develop within them the marks of true character: humility, purity, authenticity, and integrity. To live a life God considers "great" is within the reach of everyone who submits to him.</p></p><p><p>Charles R. Swindoll has devoted his life to the clear, practical teaching and application of God's Word. He currently pastors Stonebriar Community Church in Frisco, Texas, and serves as the chancellor of Dallas Theological Seminary. His renowned Insight for Living radio program airs around the world. Chuck and Cynthia, his partner in life and ministry, have four grown children and ten grandchildren.</p>The humble shepherd David later became the great King David, spoken of in the Bible. Michael Kramer contrasts young David&#39;s sins and poor choices with his later courage and devotion to God--which led to his being described as &#39;&#39;a man after God&#39;s own heart.&#39;&#39; After Kramer&#39;s versatile range and skill depicts David&#39;s mighty battle with Goliath, Swindoll advises listeners to use their personal memories of past victories for battles with their own giants. With succinct clarity Kramer delivers additional spiritual tips from the author: Don&#39;t fight using your own strength--rely on the Lord. Don&#39;t abuse God&#39;s grace. Listen when God says no. Don&#39;t be intimidated or overly sensitive. Trust God, pray, and see through the &#39;&#39;eyes of faith.&#39;&#39; G.D.W. � AudioFile 2010, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</h2><p><p><b>The inspiration for the major motion picture, <i>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</i> starring Gary Oldman and Colin Firth </b></p><p>The first novel in John le Carr�'s celebrated Karla trilogy, <i>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</i> is a heart-stopping tale of international intrigue.</p><p>The man he knew as "Control" is dead, and the young Turks who forced him out now run the Circus.

It will not call off the Quest for its origins.&#34; The opening chapters of Genesis -- important at any time -- have been the focal point of controversy for more than a century. Few topics have been so hotly debated by theologians, philosophers and scientists alike. Henri Blocher argues that our primary task is to discover what these key chapters of the Bible originally meant. Only then will we be able to unravel the knotty issues surrounding human origins. Taking into account a vast array of scholarship, Blocher provides a detailed study of creation week, the image of God, the significance of male and female, the garden covenant, the Fall, the curse and the promise of redemption. He also offers significanct theological insights into the creation-evolution debate.</p><p>In October 2003, Henri Blocher was appointed to the Guenther H.

In fact, Mrs. Jeffries&#39; polished detective skills prove once again that behind every great man, there&#39;s a great woman.</p><p>Having married an Englishman in 1976, <b>Cheryl Arguile</b> lived near London for a while before moving back to California, where she had been brought up. She then decided to embark on a writing career first as a romantic novelist (Sarah Temple) and later writing for young adults (Cheryl Lanham) but is best known as Emily Brightwell for the Mrs Jeffries series.Though completely inept, Inspector Gerald Witherspoon has gained a reputation as Victorian-era Scotland Yard's shining star, thanks to his household staff, headed by Mrs. Jeffries, a policeman's widow. Mrs. Jeffries solves Witherspoon's mysteries without ever letting anyone, Witherspoon included, know she and the staff are involved. In this, romance writer Brightwell's ( Kindred Spirits ) first mystery, Mrs. Jeffries leads the dim-witted Witherspoon to the obvious solution to the poisoning of the thoroughly despicable Dr. Bartholomew Slocum. Displaying his Victorian class prejudice, despite a lack of motive or evidence, Witherspoon decides the murderer is Slocum's cook, who for unknown reasons left the employ of the Duke of Bedford to work for the doctor.It's up to Mrs. Jeffries to discover the true identity of the murderer. Unconvincing red herrings and cliches abound, and sharp readers will spot the murderer early on--he proves to be the least likely person. Brightwell makes Witherspoon almost overbearingly dumb and puts insufficient effort into the mystery itself, which quickly becomes tedious. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Voices of the True Woman Movement: A Call to the Counter-Revolution (True Woman)</h2><p><p>In spring 2008, over 6,000 assembled in Chicago to hear a counter-revolutionary call from leaders like&nbsp;John Piper, Mary Kassian,&nbsp;Joni Eareckson-Tada,&nbsp;Karen Loritts, Janet Parshall, and&nbsp;Nancy Leigh DeMoss.<br><br>These voices launched the call to return to biblical womanhood, and thousands of women responded.&nbsp;Now <i>they</i> are the voices heard in communities, churches, and ministries worldwide.&nbsp;The True Woman Movement began.&nbsp;Experience the birth for the first time, or relive True Woman &#x2019;08, with <i>The Voices of the True Woman Movement</i>.&nbsp; <br><br>Read: </p><ul><li>John Piper&#x2019;s compelling opening "The Ultimate Meaning of 'True Woman'"</li><li>Mary Kassian&#x2019;s explanation of why biblical womanhood is counter-revolutionary in "You&#x2019;ve come a Long Way Baby!"</li><li>Joni Eareckson Tada&#x2019;s confirmation that women are "God&#x2019;s Jewels" </li><li>Karen Loritts&#x2019; challenge to choose in "A Resolve to Believe"<i>&nbsp; </i></li><li>Janet Parshall's description of "A Woman After God&#x2019;s Own Heart"&nbsp; </li><li>Nancy Leigh DeMoss's charge&nbsp;of revival in "From Him, Through Him, To Him."</li></ul><p><b>Includes&nbsp;<i>Going Deeper:&nbsp;A Guide for Personal Reflection and Small Group Discussion, </i>a robust 9-session study into a biblical way of thinking about womanhood.</b></p></p><p><b>NANCY DEMOSS WOLGEMUTH</b> has touched the lives of millions of women through <i>Revive Our Hearts</i> and the True Woman movement, calling them to heart revival and biblical womanhood.

If only I could wear those clothes, belong to that group, drive that car, live in that house, be (or be with) that person? Postrel identifies the three essential elements in all forms of glamour and explains how they work to create a distinctive sensation of projection and yearning.<br> <br><i>The Power of Glamour</i> is the very first book to explain what glamour really is&#x2014;not just style or a personal quality but a phenomenon that reveals our inner lives and shapes our decisions, large and small.

Its magic stretches beyond the stereotypical spheres of fashion or film, influencing our decisions about what to buy, where to live, which careers to pursue, where to invest, and how to vote.<br> <br>The result is myth shattering: a revelatory theory that explains how glamour became a powerful form of nonverbal persuasion, one that taps into our most secret dreams and deepest yearnings to influence our everyday choices.</p><p><b>Virginia Postrel</b> is a columnist for <i>Bloomberg View</i> and has been a regular contributor to <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and<i> Forbes</i>.

She lives in Los Angeles.&nbsp;The Power of Glamour ONE<p></p> THE MAGIC OF GLAMOUR<p></p> <br>When she was four years old, Michaela DePrince saw a picture that changed her life. Then known as Mabinty Bangura, she was living in an orphanage in Sierra Leone; her father had been murdered during the country&#x2019;s civil war, and her mother had starved to death. Even among the orphans the little girl was an outcast, deemed an unadoptable &#x201c;devil child&#x201d; because of her rebellious personality and the vitiligo that left white patches on her dark skin.<br> <br>One day, a discarded Western magazine blew against the orphanage&#x2019;s fence, carrying with it an image from a mysterious and distant world. &#x201c;There was a lady on it, she was on her tippy-toes, in this pink, beautiful tutu,&#x201d; DePrince recalls. &#x201c;I had never seen anything like this&#x2014;a costume that stuck out with glitter on it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I could just see the beauty in that person and the hope and the love and just everything that I didn&#x2019;t have.&#x201d; She thought, &#x201c;This is what I want to be.&#x201d; Entranced by the photo, the little girl ripped off the magazine&#x2019;s cover and hid it in her underwear. Every night she would gaze at it and dream. The image of the graceful, smiling ballerina &#x201c;represented freedom, it represented hope, it represented trying to live a little longer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Seeing it completely saved me,&#x201d; she says. She yearned &#x201c;to become this exact person.&#x201d;<br> <br>DePrince was lucky. Adopted by an American couple not long after she found the magazine, she showed her new mother the tattered clipping and began studying ballet when she settled in New Jersey. By age seven she was already dancing en pointe, and in 2012, at seventeen, she joined the Dance Theatre of Harlem as a professional ballerina. &#x201c;I just moved along fast,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;because I was so determined to be like that person on the magazine.&#x201d;1<br> <br>DePrince&#x2019;s story is not just a heartwarming tale. It&#x2019;s an illustration of a common and powerful phenomenon. The same imaginative process that led an orphaned child to see her ideal self in a photo of a ballerina has sent nations to war and put men on the moon, transformed the landscape and built business empires. It made California the Golden State and Paris the City of Light. Cinema and fashion traffic in it; so do tourism and construction. It sells penthouses and cruises, sports cars and high-heeled shoes, college educations and presidential candidates. It inspires religious vocations and scientific research, suicidal terrorism and show-business dreams. It gives form to desire and substance to hope.<br> <br>Glamour. The word itself has mystique, spelled even in American English with that exotic u. When we hear &#x201c;glamour,&#x201d; we envision beautiful movie stars in designer gowns or imagine sleek sports cars and the dashing men who drive them. For a moment, we project ourselves into the world they represent, a place in which we, too, are beautiful, admired, graceful, courageous, accomplished, desired, powerful, wealthy, or at ease. Glamour, the fashion writer Alicia Drake observes, offers &#x201c;the implicit promise of a life devoid of mediocrity.&#x201d;2 It lifts us out of everyday experience and makes our desires seem attainable. Glamour, writes the fashion critic Robin Givhan, &#x201c;makes us feel good about ourselves by making us believe that life can sparkle.&#x201d;3<br> <br>Consider two glamorous images. The first, from a 2008 ad for the Riviera Palm Springs hotel, employs the stereotypical elements of what many people think of as glamour. With their glistening luxury, the black limousine, white satin, and pearl necklaces hark back to the black-and-white films of the 1930s, evoking the styles we now call &#x201c;old Hollywood glamour.&#x201d; Glowing against the desert twilight in her strapless gown and elegant updo, the model contrasts with the dimly lit photographers in their jeans, distancing herself from their workaday world. She is special&#x2014;the center of attention and the embodiment of luxury, admiration, and fame. Even as she smiles for the cameras, she remains inaccessible; her cool self-possession is cordoned off from the eager camera flashes by a velvet rope. She doesn&#x2019;t look us in the eye, preserving her mystery and allowing us to enter the photo and imagine ourselves in her place: transformed into stars, living a life of excitement and acclaim in the Palm Springs of legend.<br><br><br> <br>By not looking us in the eye, the model allows us to enter the photo and imagine ourselves in her place: transformed into stars, living a life of excitement and acclaim in the Palm Springs of legend.<br>Riviera Palm Springs<br><br>If the Riviera scene represents popular stereotypes of &#x201c;glamour,&#x201d; Toni Frissell&#x2019;s evocative 1947 photograph of a lithe young woman in tennis clothes, at the beginning of this chapter, reminds us that glamour&#x2019;s essential elements have nothing to do with red carpets, limousines, or satin gowns. Here we see a more tranquil picture of a desert getaway. Perched gracefully on a curving stucco wall, the model looks not at the viewer but at the hills beyond. Like the Riviera&#x2019;s star, she appears poised and self-contained; this woman, however, appears to be alone. We follow her gaze, trace the light along the top of her extended arm, and imagine the sun on our own skin. We do not know who or where she is, nor do we need to. The mystery again encourages us to project ourselves into the scene, filling in the details with our own desires. Rather than documenting a particular place or fashion moment, the portrait evokes timeless ideals. It embodies youth, beauty, athleticism, self-possession, wealth, leisure, and&#x2014;published in a February issue of Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar&#x2014;escape to a benign eternal summer. (No sweat, sunburn, or dehydration here.) This image, too, heightens the viewer&#x2019;s yearning for the life it represents: not of fame and excitement in this case but of tranquility and ease. It, too, is glamorous.<br> <br>Although people often equate them, glamour is not the same as beauty, stylishness, luxury, celebrity, or sex appeal. It is not limited to fashion or film, nor is it intrinsically feminine. It is not a collection of aesthetic markers&#x2014;a style, as fashion and design use the word.4 Glamour is, rather, a form of nonverbal rhetoric, which moves and persuades not through words but through images, concepts, and totems. (Even when conjured as word-pictures, glamorous images are perceived and remembered as emotionally resonant snapshots, not verbal descriptions.) By binding image and desire, glamour gives us pleasure, even as it heightens our yearning. It leads us to feel that the life we dream of exists, and to desire it even more.<br><br><br> <br>Photo by Grey Crawford, interior design by Darryl Wilson<br><br>Though usually a transitory pleasure, this sensation can also inspire life-changing action. From the cub reporters imagining themselves as the Woodward and Bernstein of All the President&#x2019;s Men to the forensic-science students inspired by CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, young people flock to careers made suddenly glamorous by dramas that highlight professions&#x2019; importance and downplay their tedium.5 For the novelist Yiyun Li, then a child in 1970s China, the glamour of American life emanated from a Western candy wrapper, the prize of her collection: &#x201c;It was made of cellophane with transparent gold and silver stripes, and if you looked through it, you would see a gilded world, much fancier than our everyday, dull life.&#x201d; The wrapper, she writes, &#x201c;was the seed of a dream that came true: I left China for an American graduate school in 1996 and have lived here since.&#x201d;6<br><br><br> <br>Courtesy of Aston Martin<br><br>Glamour is powerfully persuasive. Yet because it relies on imagery and channels desire, it is often dismissed as trivial, frivolous, and superficial. Photographers use glamour euphemistically to refer to soft-core erotica; interior design magazines apply the word to anything shiny or luxurious; and many self-styled &#x201c;glamour addicts&#x201d; assume glamour refers only to fashion, makeup, or hairstyling. Those who do take the phenomenon seriously tend to be critics, who condemn glamour as a base, manipulative fraud. &#x201c;We are bewitched by the false god of glamour and the fake promise of advertising,&#x201d; writes the British clergyman and journalist Martin Wroe.7 But there is much more to glamour than either &#x201c;addicts&#x201d; or critics imagine. Even in its most seemingly frivolous forms, glamour shapes our most fundamental choices and illuminates our deepest yearnings. Although often perilous and always selective, it is not intrinsically malign. Glamour, as we shall see throughout this book, is a pervasive, complex, and often life-enhancing force.<br> <br><br> <br>Glamour is, as David Hume said of luxury, &#x201c;a word of an uncertain signification.&#x201d;8 In recent years, cultural-studies scholars have attempted to limn histories of glamour.9 But without addressing the underlying psychology or adequately developing a theory of exactly how glamour works, such research tends to devolve into catchall chronicles of fashion and celebrity. The results can be ludicrous, as when the historian Stephen Gundle declares Paris Hilton &#x201c;indisputably glamorous.&#x201d;10 At the height of her celebrity, Hilton was many things: rich, famous, photogenic, sexy, pretty, and stylishly dressed. But few adults found her glamorous. She was the anti&#x2013;Grace Kelly, the touchstone people cited when trying to explain what is not glamorous.11<br><br><br> <br>John Althouse Cohen under CC BY 2.0 license<br><br>To avoid such pitfalls, this book begins by building a definition of glamour that allows us to distinguish glamour from style, celebrity, or fame; to establish the relationship between glamour and such associated phenomena as charisma, romance, spectacle, elegance, and sex appeal; and to identify the common elements uniting disparate versions of glamour across audiences and cultural contexts.<br> <br>In this chapter, we begin to understand what kind of phenomenon glamour is: like humor, a form of communication that elicits a distinctive emotional response. In the next chapter, we&#x2019;ll identify and investigate that response&#x2014;a sense of projection and longing&#x2014;and explore why so many different objects can produce it: what glamour does. We will discover that, like the gilded world seen through a candy wrapper, glamour is an illusion &#x201c;known to be false but felt to be true,&#x201d; which focuses and intensifies a preexisting but previously inchoate yearning. The following three chapters then extract and examine the essential elements&#x2014;a promise of escape and transformation; grace; and mystery&#x2014;that appear in all versions of glamour and distinguish it from other forms of nonverbal rhetoric, thus explaining how glamour works.<br> <br>As we develop this theory, we&#x2019;ll also learn how to detect glamour&#x2019;s less-obvious manifestations and, potentially, how to construct or dispel it. The theory allows us to understand why such diverse and sometimes contradictory things can seem glamorous: how Jackie Kennedy is like the Chrysler Building or a sports car like a Moleskine notebook, or why some audiences might find glamour in nuns, wind turbines, or Star Trek. We&#x2019;ll also resolve certain smaller puzzles. Why, for instance, is glamour so easily lost? How can it be associated so strongly with both elegance and sex appeal? What is its connection to androgyny? Why are certain aesthetic tropes, such as glittering light, silhouettes, or black-and-white imagery, so often associated with it?<br> <br>Having built a specific definition for glamour, we can then examine its history without fear of going astray. Beginning with chapter six, we&#x2019;ll trace the growth and evolution of glamour as both a spontaneous phenomenon and a calculated tool of persuasion. We&#x2019;ll first examine how, and under what conditions, glamour manifested itself in premodern times and how it changed and proliferated with the growth of large, commercial cities. Then, in chapter seven, we&#x2019;ll look at the forms and influence of glamour in the twentieth century, focusing on its importance in exploring and defining modernity. Finally, we&#x2019;ll consider how glamour has evolved in today&#x2019;s media-savvy and fragmented culture.<br> <br>In addition to the book&#x2019;s primary text, which uses examples to identify and illustrate theoretical and historical patterns, the &#x201c;Icon&#x201d; sidebars offer detailed examinations of glamorous archetypes. Instead of focusing on one specific feature of glamour, each icon allows us to see glamour&#x2019;s many different aspects at work simultaneously. Together, the icons also demonstrate the wide variety of glamour&#x2019;s manifestations, from the fashionable femininity of the Gibson Girl to the high-tech freedom of wirelessness. Like most of the book&#x2019;s images, the icons are placed in chapters where they have particular resonance or complement the argument, but they are not addressed in the main text. Holographically drawing on the book&#x2019;s ideas, the content of each &#x201c;Icon&#x201d; sidebar is not limited to the subject of a single chapter, and the sidebars need not be read in a particular order.<br> <br><br> <br>We begin not with the phenomenon but with the word, whose history offers valuable clues to the nature of glamour. Popularized in English by Sir Walter Scott at the turn of the nineteenth century, the old Scots word glamour described a literal magic spell. Glamour (or a glamour) made its subject see things that weren&#x2019;t there. A 1721 glossary of poetry explained: &#x201c;When devils, wizards or jugglers deceive the sight, they are said to cast glamour o&#x2019;er the eyes of the spectator.&#x201d;12 Glamour could, Scott wrote in 1805, &#x201c;make a ladye seem a knight; / The cobwebs on a dungeon wall / Seem tapestry in lordly hall.&#x201d; That power was believed to stretch into the real world. In his diary, Scott worried that &#x201c;a kind of glamour about me&#x201d; was making him overlook errors in his page proofs; he wondered whether the right herbal concoction &#x201c;would dispel this fascination.&#x201d;13 (As both magic and metaphor, glamour and fascination are closely related.)<br> <br>During the nineteenth century, glamour expanded to include less literal charms, while maintaining the sense of making things look better than they really were. &#x201c;The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,&#x201d; Mr. Rochester tells Jane Eyre when she calls his mansion splendid, &#x201c;and you see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate, and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.&#x201d;14 In his 1898 novella Youth, Joseph Conrad wrote, &#x201c;Oh, the glamour of youth! Oh, the fire of it, more dazzling than the flames of the burning ship, throwing a magic light on the wide earth, leaping audaciously to the sky.&#x201d; He wistfully recalled &#x201c;the deceitful feeling that lures us on to joys, to perils, to love, to vain effort.&#x201d;15<br> <br>Note that Conrad is not saying that it is glamorous to be young&#x2014;a judgment from the outside. Rather, his &#x201c;glamour of youth&#x201d; is an internal, psychological state. Young people, he suggests, are particularly susceptible to glamour.

Jean M. Auel, a storytelling genius, weaves a compellingly readable saga of human survival; an epic that transcends time and place. It is peopled with rich and complex characters who experience the full range of human emotions. All this makes for total involvement and believability in the light of today. A novel for all time.</p><p>When her parents are killed by an earthquake, 5-year-old Ayla wanders through the forest completely alone. Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, the little girl is as good as gone until she is discovered by a group who call themselves the Clan of the Cave Bear. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, have little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the "Others." Only their medicine woman sees in Ayla a fellow human, worthy of care. She painstakingly nurses her back to health--a decision that will forever alter the physical and emotional structure of the clan. Although this story takes place roughly 35,000 years ago, its cast of characters could easily slide into any modern tale. The members of the Neanderthal clan, ruled by traditions and taboos, find themselves challenged by this outsider, who represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. And as Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle.<p> Although Jean Auel obviously takes certain liberties with the actions and motivations of all our ancestors, her extensive research into the Ice Age does shine through--especially in the detailed knowledge of plants and natural remedies used by the medicine woman and passed down to Ayla. Mostly, though, this first in the series of four is a wonderful story of survival. Ayla's personal evolution is a compelling and relevant tale. <i>--Sara Nickerson</i></p>The stunning epic that stirred the imagination of millions. Here is a novel of awesome beauty and power. A moving saga about people, relationships and the boundaries of love. Through Jean Auel&#39;s magnificent storytelling, we are taken back to the dawn of mankind and swept up in the wonderful world of a very special heroine, Ayla. Her enthralling story is one we all can share. A natural disaster has left young Ayla alone, wandering, fending for herself in an unfamiliar land. One day, she is discovered by the Clan of the Cave bear, men and women far different from her own people. Tall, blond, blue-eyed Ayla is a mysterious stranger to the Clan and at first they mistrust her and cast her out. But as she grows to know them and to learn the ways of the Clan, she is welcomed. And as she leads them in their struggle for survival, the Clan come to worship Ayla. For in her blood flows the future of humanity.</p><h2>Negotiate This!: By Caring, But Not T-H-A-T Much</h2><p>The author of You Can Negotiate Anything (1980), Cohen has been a practicing negotiator for three-plus decades, acting on behalf of U.S. presidents, corporate CEOs, sports and theatrical agents, the U.S. State Department, the CIA, and the FBI. Using a personable, conversational tone, Cohen relays examples from his own experiences as a professional negotiator to give readers insights into human problems and situations and advice for handling them. Annotation (c) Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Herb Cohen lives in Washington, D.C.Cohen is an accomplished, successful negotiator, a talent that appears largely attributable to his creative intelligence, his intense focus on attaining his client's goals and a negotiating style that is low-key, humorous and flexible. His primary message in this book is the negotiator's need to cultivate a certain detachment-hence the book's subtitle. It also offers street-smart advice on effective demeanor, a cooperative style and the bargaining process. About a third of the book is devoted to the "perceptual TIP"-in which Cohen explains how to manipulate the perceived levels of time, information and power to create an advantage in negotiations. All of this advice is buried in an entertaining melange of stories ranging from biblical tales through real-life business negotiations to everyday activities (such as convincing one's kids to come home on time), all delivered in the same unassuming tone one presumes Cohen uses at the bargaining table. Of less interest is an odd chapter that combines the author's advice on terrorism and parenting and 40 pages of appendixes that reproduce documents and articles relating to the Iranian hostage crisis, Clinton's Camp David Summit in 2000 and 20-year-old warnings about the threat of terrorism. Unfortunately, the book's content is often only loosely related, as though gathered in chunks from a couple of decades of speeches or seminars. Within the chapters, new sections repeatedly interrupt mid-story. The result is a book that features the practical wisdom of experience and the ring of authority, but sometimes wanders beyond the limits of the reader's patience. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>This Is a Call: The Life and Times of Dave Grohl</h2><p><b><i>This Is a Call</i></b>, the first in-depth, definitive biography of Dave Grohl, tells the epic story of a singular career that includes Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age, and Them Crooked Vultures.

It started with the murder of a store clerk during a botched robbery. Victim number two died in a car heist as they made their getaway. Then they decide &#x201c;what the hell&#x201d; and settle a couple of personal scores. The kids are murderous but not dumb, and they avoid capture from an ever-growing cadre of pursuers that includes Virgil Flowers from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Flowers is the nominal head of the investigation, but he struggles to keep control of the various law-enforcement agencies involved. He&#x2019;s determined to take the kids alive, an end game that&#x2019;s not endorsed by his associates. As the pursuit continues, he&#x2019;s able to establish phone contact with Welsh. At least one of the killers has moved from abstraction to human, and Flowers becomes more determined than ever to bring them in alive. Flowers is a complex character camouflaged by his long hair, rock-&#x2019;n&#x2019;-roll T-shirts, smart mouth, and fearlessness. The son of a minister, he is burdened by a spirituality that subtly influences his every decision. It&#x2019;s more pronounced in this case as he fights the pack&#x2019;s need for revenge and, in the end, leaves readers assessing the morality of the kids as well as their pursuers. This may be the best entry in a stellar series. --Wes Lukowsky</p><h2>The History of Bees: The Radio 2 Bookclub selection</h2><p>England, 1851.

She considers herself lucky to be a mother of five and married to the love of her life.&nbsp;www.brendanovak.com <br><br><br>The tiny cabin Claire O'Toole's mother had once used for painting had been shut up for years. Claire was the only one who came here, and even she didn't return all that often, maybe every six months or so.<br><br>Braced for the torrent of memories that hit her every time she walked inside, she dropped the key into the pocket of her jeans and forced open a door warped from too many Montana winters. Before she crossed the threshold, however, she looked behind her, suddenly feeling she might not be as alone as she'd thought.<br><br>A gentle wind swayed the pine trees. She could hear the rustle as it traveled through the surrounding forest, but she couldn't see any movement. She couldn't see anything at all, except for what fell inside the beam of her flashlight. There were no city lights up here, no glassy lake to reflect the moon's glow, the way there was closer to town, nothing but thick forest carpeted with pine needles, cloaked in darkness and topped with a canopy of stars.<br><br>No one was sneaking up behind her. How silly to even check. There were other cabins in these mountains, but only one in the immediate vicinity. Her parents had owned it as well as this studio from when they were first married to the summer before she started school. Then they'd sold the main house and moved to town. She could still remember her mother cooking in that kitchen, the little tree house her stepfather had built in the backyard.<br><br>The house had changed hands more than once, but Isaac Morgan owned it now, so she stayed clear. Avoiding it minimized the number of times she and Isaac ran into each other. He filmed wildlife all around the world and was often gone, which helped. Although he lived closest to the studio, she couldn't imagine any reason <em>he'd</em> be lurking in the trees. They were too busy trying to prove to each other that what they'd had ten years ago had been as easy to leave behind as it should've been.<br><br>So who else could it be? Her sister, her stepfather and his wife, her best friend and her best friend's sheriff husband&#x2014;in fact, nearly all of Pineview's 1,500 residents&#x2014;were watching Fourth of July fireworks in the city park across the street from the cemetery. She could hear the distant boom of each explosion, smell the smoke that drifted up against the mountain.<br><br>No one had noticed when she slipped away.<br><br>Drawing a deep breath, she turned back and focused on the dusty interior. Cast-off furniture from her stepfather, her stepfather's wife and her maternal grandparents crowded the living room. Cobwebs hung from the rafters; rat droppings littered the floor. Pack rats built nests everywhere in this part of the state, even in the engines of cars.<br><br>This wasn't the magical place it'd been when she was a child. The good memories had been conquered and overrun, broken by tragedy, but she returned, anyway. She couldn't ignore the studio's existence and move on, like everybody else. Invariably, the past dragged her back.<br><br>As she stepped inside, she paused to listen. She'd expected silence. But she could hear the engine of her old Camaro ticking as it cooled in the overgrown drive. Then a creak, coming from the loft above. When other creaks followed, it almost sounded as if her mother was walking around up there like she used to.<br><br>Obviously, Claire's imagination had kicked into overdrive, reacting to the isolation and the spookiness of coming here after dark.<br><br>Or maybe it was her subconscious, trying to get her out before she could come across something that might disrupt what little peace of mind she had left. Her mother had been missing for fifteen years and in all that time they'd never found a trace of her. Her sister had broken her back sledding two years later and been confined to a wheelchair. And David, her husband, had died only a year ago in a terrible hunting accident. She couldn't tolerate another loss.<br><br>And yet she kept digging for the truth.<br><br>What if she discovered that her stepfather had killed her mother, as so many others believed? Or what if her mother had run off with another man, willingly left them for a new life somewhere else, as the previous sheriff had suggested?<br><br>She'd be devastated. Again. But she couldn't accept either of those possibilities. Her stepfather was a good man; he would never have hurt Alana. Alana was a loving mother; she would never have abandoned her children. That meant someone had kidnapped her, maybe killed her, and would get away with it unless Claire made sure that didn't happen. Who else would fight for justice?<br><br>Not Leanne. Claire's sister battled enough challenges. Leanne didn't even want to think about the day they'd lost their mother, let alone look into it. And her stepfather&#x2014; Tug, as his friends called him&#x2014;had moved in with the woman who'd eventually become her stepmother only six months after Alana went missing. At this late date, he wouldn't have known what to do with Alana even if she reappeared.<br><br>Only Claire held on. She was all her mother had left, and that made it impossible to give up, no matter how many people told her she should. Her mother deserved more than that.<br><br>At least obsessing about the mystery that had tormented her for half her life kept her from dwelling on David, a loss that was far too recent and still too raw.<br><br>Another creak. She almost lost her nerve. Maybe she should've waited until tomorrow. But her sister lived in the house right next door to hers and was constantly dropping by. It was difficult for Claire to get away without divulging <em>something</em> about where she was going and what she was doing. And because Claire ran her business, a hair salon, out of her home, if it wasn't her sister, it was one of her many clients, who paid more attention than Claire wanted. Thanks to her mother's disappearance, she'd always been watched a little too carefully. Everyone was waiting to see whether she'd recover or fall apart. That was the reason she wanted to move away&#x2014;so she could be anonymous for a change, start over&#x2014;a desire that had only grown more intense after David died. Except for two years when their relationship had faltered while he was in college, they'd been together since they were sixteen. Losing him meant becoming the object of everyone's pity once again.<br><br><em>How are you? You hangin' in there, kiddo?</em><br><br>She got questions like that, spoken in low, somber tones, all the time. She wouldn't have minded so much if the people who asked were as sincere as they sounded and not just inviting her to provide them with a bit of tantalizing gossip for the next community gathering or church event. <em>Poor Claire. She's suffering so. I talked to her last week and...</em><br><br>Claire didn't need anyone gabbing about her efforts to solve the mystery. Or conjecturing on what she might or might not find at the studio. Or confronting her family with the fact that she'd been here. That was why she kept whatever she could to herself. Why create more curiosity? It would only upset those who'd rather forget...<br><br>So, frightening though it was, she liked the cover of darkness. It made her feel as close to anonymous as she could get in the place where she'd grown up. The noises she heard were nothing to worry about. No one would have any reason to hang out in an abandoned studio that didn't have electricity or running water. If some vagabond had moved in, there'd be proof of occupancy.<br><br>Knocking the cobwebs out of the way, she followed the beam of her flashlight through the cluster of furniture. Then she climbed up to the loft, where her mother used to paint. She'd loved watching Alana work, had never felt more at peace than here, with the sun pouring through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the second floor, her mother standing in the light, concentrating on her latest masterpiece.<br><br>Several unfinished paintings perched on easels covered with sheets, looking like ghosts floating a couple of feet off the ground. The sight of them made Claire sick with loss, a loss rivaled only by David's death. Whoever had taken Alana had robbed the world, and Claire, of so much.<br><br>Was it someone she knew? Someone she passed on the street, spoke to, cared about? One of those people who always asked how she was?<br><br>It had to be, didn't it? Alana went missing from their house in town in the dead of winter. Although this part of Montana saw an influx of hunters, fisherman and rec-reationists during the spring, summer and fall, it was not a place to visit in the cold months. Libby, thirty miles away, was the closest town. Notorious for the asbestos mine that'd made everyone sick and caused the death of two hundred people, Libby had been in the news a lot in recent years. But on the day Alana had gone missing, it was still just a spot on the map, and an overturned truck carrying vermiculite ore had blocked traffic on the highway for hours. The sheriff himself hadn't been able to get through until it was cleared.<br><br>Claire supposed some "bad man" could've come from the other direction, from Marion or Kalispell, but no one had spotted any strangers that day. Even more significant, there'd been no sign of forced entry at the house. Whoever had taken Alana was most likely someone she trusted. She'd opened her door, never expecting to be harmed.<br><br>The betrayal inherent in that scenario made Claire more determined than anything else to solve the mystery. Dragging a chair from the corner, the very chair in which she used to sit and daydream while her mother painted, Claire climbed up to reach the handle that would open the attic door. Just shy of five foot three, she could barely grab hold, but once she caught it, the pull-down ladder lowered easily enough.<br><br>It was warmer in the small space above Alana's studio. Dustier, too. Claire coughed as she poked her head through the opening and used her flashlight to re-acquaint herself with the contents.<br><br>Boxes stacked floor to ceiling left little room in which to maneuver. She hadn't remembered it being quite so crowded. But when it became clear that her mother wasn't coming back, Claire had insisted that everything Alana owned, down to the razor she'd been using in the shower, be preserved. The sheriff's department had confiscated the contents of Alana's desk, her computer, any recent letters she'd written or received, the photos she'd snapped in the months prior to her disappearance, her journal, the things left in her car&#x2014;anything they thought might help them find her. Claire and Leanne had taken possession of any sentimental items that remained. And the rest had been packed up and stored here years ago, just after Claire graduated from high school and moved out&#x2014;and her stepfather and his wife bought the luxurious home they currently enjoyed, the home they'd bought with the inheritance Alana had received when her parents died in a plane crash only a year before she disappeared.<br><br>Riddled with guilt for even thinking that her mother's misfortune had provided such a spectacular living for the woman who'd replaced her, Claire steered her mind away from that direction. She liked her stepmother. It wasn't Roni's fault that Alana was no longer around.<br><br>But it bothered Claire that Roni acted as if Alana had never existed. Tug and Leanne preferred to handle the situation the same way. They'd both asked Claire to forget the past. Learning what happened wouldn't bring Alana back, they said. And it was true. It was also true that Leanne seemed to do better if she didn't have to be reminded of that fateful day. Which was why, after pleading for the new sheriff to reopen the case a couple of years ago, Claire had gone back to call him off. Her family had been too upset about the questions he was asking. They couldn't tolerate the assumptions and suspicions that were inevitable in such a small community.<br><br>Claire respected their position. But she couldn't stop digging entirely. She needed resolution as much as they needed to forget.<br><br>What she was hoping to accomplish by coming here tonight, however, she didn't know. She'd been through all this stuff so many times. Her stepfather, his wife and Leanne had seen it, too. The three of them had packed it together.<br><br>But Claire couldn't help hoping that she'd see something she'd missed before, that some clue would emerge and solve the mystery. That happened all the time on those forensics shows.<br><br>Squeezing through the narrow pathway, she moved toward a box that contained her mother's childhood memorabilia&#x2014;Alana's report cards, her early journals, pictures of her family and friends. Claire loved looking through that box because it made her feel closer to the woman she missed so terribly. And it was as good a place to begin as any. She planned on going through every last box, even if that meant frequent trips to the studio over the next few weeks.<br><br>She bent to lift it, then saw some boxes that had been packed <em>much</em> more recently. They stood out because they were labeled in her own handwriting. <em>David's Clothes, David's Things, David's Yearbooks.</em><br><br>Her hand flew to her chest as if she could stop that familiar lump from growing in her throat, but she couldn't. What were her late husband's personal belongings doing here? She hadn't expected to find them, wasn't ready for such a powerful reminder.<br><br></p><h2>Handbook on Abortion</h2><p>Illustrated with very graphic dumped fetus and abortion related photographs, this &#34;handbook&#34; presents the pro-life side of the abortion controversy. 151 pages..</p><p></p><h2>Armed</h2><p>The gun control debate is often obscured by strong emotions and unproven assumptions. According to conventional wisdom accidents with handguns account for a significant number of deaths among children, gun owners endanger themselves more than they ward off potential criminal assailants, and there is a widespread legal consensus that the Second Amendment does not support the individual right to bear arms. All of these assumptions, and many others, say researchers Gary Kleck and Don Kates, are contradicted by the weight of criminological and legal evidence. Hoping to disentangle myth from reality, the authors summarize the results and policy implications of recent state-of-the-art research on guns and violence in accessible, nontechnical language.Among the topics addressed are media bias in coverage of gun issues, the distorting effects that a covert prohibitionist agenda has on the debate over more moderate measures for reducing gun violence, the frequency and effectiveness of the defensive use of guns, and a close analysis of the Second Amendment.This well-argued and scrupulously researched volume is essential for any full understanding of the complex gun issue.</p><p>&#34;If you believe, as I once did, that we can reduce violent crime by simply restricting gun ownership, you should read this book. It will change your basic beliefs.&#34; -- Steven B.

My name doesn't matter. The hut I was born in, and where I'm soon to die, sits at the edge of the woods. They say these woods go on and on, right to the ocean that surrounds the entire world; they say that wooden houses like mine travel on that ocean. I wouldn't know; I've never seen it. I've not seen the <i>other</i> side of the woods, either. My older brother, when we were boys he made me swear that between the two of us we'd hack away at this woods till there wasn't a tree left standing. My brother is dead now, and now it's something else I'm after, and always will be. Over in the direction where the sun goes down there's a creek I fish in with my hands. There are wolves in the woods, but the wolves don't scare me, and my ax has never failed me. I've not kept track of how old I am, but I know I'm old&#x2014;my eyes don't see anymore. Down in the village, which I don't venture into anymore because I'd lose my way, everyone says I'm a miser, but how much could a woodcutter have saved up? </p><p>I keep the door of my house shut with a rock so the snow won't get in. One evening I heard heavy, dragging footsteps and then a knock. I opened the door and a stranger came in. He was a tall, elderly man all wrapped up in a worn-out old blanket. A scar sliced across his face. The years looked to have given him more authority than frailty, but even so I saw it was hard for him to walk without leaning on his stick. We exchanged a few words I don't recall now. The finally the man said: </p><p> &#x201c;I am without a home, and I sleep wherever I can. I have wandered all across Saxony.&#x201d; </p><p>His words befitted his age. My father always talked about &#x201c;Saxony&#x201d;; now people call it England. </p><p>There was bread and some fish in the house. While we ate, we didn't talk. It started raining. I took some skins and made him a pallet on the dirt floor where my brother had died. When night came we slept. </p><p>It was toward dawn when we left the house. The rain had stopped and the ground was covered with new snow. The man dropped his stick and he ordered me to pick it up. </p><p> &#x201c;Why should I do what you tell me to?&#x201d; I said to him. </p><p> &#x201c;Because I am a king,&#x201d; he answered. </p><p>I thought he was mad. I picked up the stick and gave it to him. </p><p>With his next words, his voice was changed. </p><p> &#x201c;I am the king of the Secgans. Many times did I lead them to victory in hard combat, but at the hour that fate decreed, I lost my kingdom. My name is Isern and I am of the line of Odin.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;I do not worship Odin,&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;I worship Christ.&#x201d; </p><p>He went on as though he'd not heard me. </p><p> &#x201c;I wander the paths of exile, but still I am king, for I have the disk. Do you want to see it?&#x201d; </p><p>He opened his hand and showed me his bony palm. There was nothing in it. His hand was empty. It was only then that I realized he'd always kept it shut tight. </p><p>He looked me in the eye. </p><p> &#x201c;You may touch it.&#x201d; </p><p>I had my doubts, but I reached out and with my fingertips I touched his palm. I felt something cold, and I saw a quick gleam. His hand snapped shut. I said nothing. </p><p> &#x201c;It is the disk of Odin,&#x201d; the old man said in a patient voice, as though he were speaking to a child. &#x201c;It had but one side. There is not another thing on earth that has but one side. So long as I hold it in my hand I shall be king.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Is it gold?&#x201d; I said. </p><p> &#x201c;I know not. It is the disk of Odin and it has but one side.&#x201d; </p><p>It was then I felt a gnawing to own the disk myself. If it were mine, I could sell it for a bar of gold and then <i>I</i> would be a king. </p><p> &#x201c;In my hut I've got a chest full of money hidden away. Gold coins, and they shine like my ax,&#x201d; I told the wanderer, whom I hate to this day. &#x201c;If you give the disk of Odin to me, I will give you the chest.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;I will not,&#x201d; he said gruffly. </p><p> &#x201c;Then you can continue on your way,&#x201d; I said. </p><p>He turned away. One ax blow to the back of his head was all it took; he wavered and fell, but as he fell he opened his hand, and I saw the gleam of the disk in the air. I marked the place with my ax and I dragged the body down to the creek bed, where I knew the creek was swollen. There I dumped his body. </p><p>When I got back to my house I looked for the disk. But I couldn't find it. I have been looking for it for years.</p></p><h2>School Sparks: Ignite Your Child&#39;s Success in Preschool, Kindergarten and Beyond</h2><p>You are your child&#39;s first and most important teacher.

It&#x2019;s a classic English country cottage, nestled on an inlet overlooking the Atlantic Ocean in the borough of Our Lady of Fatima, New Jersey, about five miles north of Interlaken. The fieldstone exterior gives the illusion of a small fortress, so I softened the overall effect with white hyacinth shrubs and a blanket of sky-blue morning glories cascading over the dormers like loose curls on a cherub. After all, a man&#x2019;s home must first be inviting.<br><br> Every morning at sunrise a honeyed pink light fills the front room, throwing a rosy glaze on the walls that cannot be achieved with paint. Believe me, I&#x2019;ve tried. I settled instead for a neutral shade on the walls, a delicate beige I call flan. When the walls are tame, the furnishings need to pop. So I found the perfect chintz, with giant jewel-toned flowers of turquoise, coral, and jade bursting on a butter-yellow background, to cover my Louis Quatorze sofa and chairs. The upholstery soaks up the light and warms the room better than a fire blazing in the hearth. Anyone who says you will tire of a bold pattern on your furniture is a fool. The right fabric will give you years of joy; it can become your signature. Scalamandr�&#x2019;s Triomphe #26301 has my name on it.<br><br> My day begins at dawn as I take my cup of strong black espresso outside to watch the sunrise. I learned this ritual from my mother, who worked in a bread shop. Bakers are the great philosophers of the world, mostly because they have to get up early. When the world is quiet, great art is created&#x2014;or, at the very least, conceptualized. Now is the moment to sketch, make notes, and dream.<br><br> From my front porch, a dignified, simple portal with a slate floor (I laid the charcoal-gray, dusty-mauve, and smoky-blue slabs myself), I watch the colors of the sky and sea change at the whims of the wind. Sometimes the ocean crashes in foamy white waves that look like ruffles. Then, suddenly, the light is gone and everything turns to gray satin. When the sun returns, the charcoal clouds lift away and the world becomes as tranquil as a library, the water as flat as a page in a book, Venetian glass under a blue cloudless sky.<br><br> What a boon to live on the water! Such delicious shades and hues! This is a template worthy of the greatest painters. The textures of sand and stone could inspire incomparable sculptures, and the sounds&#x2014;the steady lapping of the waves, the sweet chirping of the birds&#x2014;make this a sanctuary. I soak up the view in all its detail and translate this glorious palette to the interiors of local homes. You see, I am the Town Decorator.<br><br> Many have compared our little borough to the village my family emigrated from, the enchanting Santa Margherita nestled in the Gulf of Genoa on the Mediterranean coast of Italy. I&#x2019;ve been there, but I favor my hometown over the original. Italy, despite its earthiness and charm, can never be New Jersey. Here we value evolution and change; Italy, while it warms the heart, is a monument to the past. In America we change our rooms as often as our fashions. In Italy you&#x2019;re likely to find throw pillows older than the Shroud of Turin. It&#x2019;s just a different way to live.<br><br> Part of my job is to convince my clients that change is good, then guide them to the right choices. I remember when I installed a velvet headboard on my cousin Tiki Matera&#x2019;s double bed (she was plagued by insomnia from the cradle) and she told me that, for the first time in her life, she felt so secure that she slept through the night. That Art Deco touch changed her room and her life&#x2014;not a small thing. That&#x2019;s the business I&#x2019;m really in: creating appropriate surroundings to provide comfort and that essential touch of glamour. I built my company, the House of B, and my reputation on it. HOB stands for the eye of Bartolomeo di Crespi and the guts of beauty itself: truth, color, and dramatic sweep, from slipcover to oven mitt. I don&#x2019;t fool around.<br><br> My work can&#x2019;t be defined by one particular style. The rococo period where French design and Italian flair came together make my heart leap for joy in my chest. But, I love them all: Chinese Modern, Regency English, French Norman, Prairie Nouveau, Victorian (without the precious), Early American (with the precious), all the Louises from I through V (Vuitton, of course), postwar, prewar, bungalow, foxhole, and even the occasional log cabin. I can go big and I can do small.<br><br> I work from the inside out. Truly great interior design includes the rooms you live in and everything your eye can see from your windows. I often bring the colors from outside indoors, which soothes the soul and creates harmony. I may install a reflecting pool outside your living room to catch the moonlight, or plant a garden of wildflowers with a rose arbor anchored over a flowing fountain beyond your kitchen window, or perhaps place a wrought-iron loveseat surrounded by lilac bushes outside your bedroom for a midnight rendezvous.<br><br> Your home should inspire you to greater heights of emotion. It should crackle with color and pizzazz. Every detail is important; every tassel, tieback, and sheer should say something. Under my trained eye, stale corners become Roman baths, while bland entryways become magnificent foyers and crappy pasteboard ceilings become frescoes. Let&#x2019;s face it, I can take a ranch and turn it into a villa. In fact, I did that very thing right on Vittorio Drive, three blocks away.<br><br> My life as a decorator began not with a sudden flash of inspiration, but with a problem. I was born without symmetry. This is not my real nose. As soon as I was old enough to pull myself up onto the stool in front of my mother&#x2019;s dressing table (an Art Deco red enamel vanity with a pink velvet seat circa 1920), where I could pull the side mirrors in to study my face from three angles, I realized that something had to be done. From the east, my nose looked like the fin on a Cadillac, from the west, a wedge of pie, and dead on, a frightening pair of black caverns, two nostrils so wide and deep you could lose your luggage in them. It had to go.<br><br> As an Italian American, I was born into a family of prominent noses. The di Crespi clan was known for their fish (Pop had a dinghy for clamming and crabbing, and a storefront in town to sell his catch) and their profiles. We were not alone. Our neighbors were also of Italian descent, many from the same village, and they too had versions of The Beak. The variations included all possible shapes, angles, and appointments, all with the same result: too large.<br><br> I was raised to be proud of my cultural and nasal heritage, so it wasn&#x2019;t shame that brought me to the surgeon, it was a desire for perfection. My instinct is to create balance. Faces, like buildings, require good bones.<br><br> As soon as I could save up enough money (I worked after school and for five summers in the Mandelbaums&#x2019; bank as a coin sorter and roller), I took the bus from Our Lady of Fatima (OLOF) to the office of Dr. Jonas Berman on East Eighty-sixth Street in Manhattan. I was eighteen years old with a spiral-bound sketch pad under my arm and a checkbook in my pocket.<br><br> First, I&#x2019;d drawn a self-portrait in charcoal, showing my original nose. Then, in a series of detailed drawings, I fashioned the nose I wanted from every angle. Dr. Berman flipped through the pad. Amazed at my artistic skill, he cited Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s pencil sketches of early flying machines as being substandard to my talent.<br><br> If I was going to have rhinoplasty, I wanted to make sure I had the nose of my dreams. I didn&#x2019;t want a hatchet job that would leave me with a Hollywood pug. I wanted regal, straight, and classic. In short, Italianate without the size. I got exactly what I wanted.<br><br> My sister, Toot (as in the song &#x201c;Toot, Toot, Tootsie,&#x201d; not the toot of a horn), who is eleven years older than me, was the first person to see my new nose when the swelling went down. She was so thrilled at the result that she convinced my father to sell his car so she could have the same surgery. My father, never one to tell a woman no, paid for her to have The Operation (as my mother came to call it). Never mind that I had worked like a farmer to earn my new profile. But I don&#x2019;t hold a grudge.<br><br> Toot elected to have her nose done not in New York City by my capable surgeon, but by a doctor in Jersey City who was rumored to have given Vic Damone his signature tilt. (I am the only person in my family who does not believe in medical bargains.) When Dr. Mavrodontis peeled Toot&#x2019;s bandages off, Mom, Pop, and I were there for the unveiling. Mama clapped her hands joyfully as Papa got a tear in his eye. Talk about change. Her new nose had a sharp tip with an upturn so steep you could hang a Christmas stocking off it. Gone was her old nose, which had looked like an elbow; but was this delicate Ann Miller version an improvement?<br><br> To be fair, the new nose gave my sister the dose of self-confidence she needed. She suddenly believed she was beautiful, so she went on a spartan diet of well-done steak and raw tomatoes and lost a good thirty pounds, tweezed her eyebrows and straightened her hair (by sleeping on wet orange-juice cans every night for a year), and, shortly thereafter, in the right pair of black clam diggers and a tight angora sweater, fell in love with Alonzo &#x201c;Lonnie&#x201d; Falcone, a jeweler, at a Knights of Columbus weenie roast in Belmar. Six months later they had a big church wedding at Our Lady of Fatima Church and three sons followed in short order. Her nose may not be p...</p><h2>Phantoms Afoot: Helping the Spirts Among Us</h2><p>This book is memorable for the downright chilling tales of actual hauntings the author (and her husband, in many cases) encountered. The author&#39;s aim in each case was to free the spirit haunting the area and, apparently, she was successful in each case. Each tale includes the legend of the haunted area and its resident ghost, the author&#39;s encounters with the ghost, and how she was able to release the spirit from the area.

Nineteen years later, in 1983, the journalist set out from his Ohio home, traversing 20 countries and hiking about 10,000 miles in four years. Newman chronicles his journey, which he undertook to prove that there are hospitable, good people around the world and that our planet is not doomed. He finds plenty of good people, but the most exciting reading involves his arrests in Turkey, Algeria, and Yugoslavia, and his run-ins with sundry officials, etc. It is also great fun to watch Newman, who had never ventured out of the United States, mature and become more acclimated to foreign cultures. The travel feat is incredible, but the book is not as enthralling as one might expect, possibly because the scope and length does not allow much insight into each culture and country.<br><i>- Melinda Stivers Leach, Precision Editorial Svces., Wondervu, Col.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.At age 28, Newman, a journalist and onetime oilfield worker, set out from his home in Bethel, Ohio, to walk the world--unsponsored, paying his own way. Four years later, he had visited 20 countries and fulfilled a dream. Nearly everywhere, he found substitute Moms (much of his story veers toward the saccharine), and new friends put him in touch with their friends. He ran into a blizzard in the Pyrenees, wild boars in Algeria and narrowly escaped a flash flood in Australia. There were three life-threatening episodes, and he was arrested in Algeria, Yugoslavia and Turkey. Newman proved himself willing to learn from other cultures, was adaptable and appreciative of hospitality. Sentimentality aside, this is a brave tale of adventure. Photos not seen by PW.

Plainspeaking and down-to-earth in his advice, this former priest points out that a wedding does not a marriage make and encourages you to build the marriage you want.<p>Graves has put together a marriage-repair kit so that any couple from the newly wed to the long-married, will have the tools to build and maintain a strong, rewarding relationship. His book promises to become a small classic, the kind of book youll want to give to newlyweds and those celebrating their golden anniversary.</p></p><p>This slender volume by a marriage counselor plies couples with common sense and good cheer. Too often, Graves contends, people think that a wedding is the marriage, and that once the honeymoon ends the marriage just takes care of itself. In fact, he argues, good marriages, like houses or cars, need regular maintenance. He speculates that 90% of all married couples "are living well below the level of their relationship potential," a term he defines as "how happy they could be." Graves explains 10 "tools" for promoting or enhancing healthy marriages: forthrightness, conflict, courtship, labels, realism, trust, friendship, distinctions, respect and sharing. Filled with anecdotes from his own marriage and those of couples in his practice, this friendly, optimistic guide would make a thoughtful Valentine's Day gift. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kindly Bent to Ease Us: Wonderment (Part 3)</h2><p>The third volume of Longchenpa&#39;s Trilogy shows the practitioner how to transcend ordinary limited perspectives using eight classic and evocative images that reveal the open nature of reality.

But as a result, something&#x2019;s been happening inside Bart&#x2019;s head that a heartless local bureaucracy isn&#x2019;t prepared for&#x2014;a complete and irrevocable burnout of the mental circuit breaker that keeps a mild-mannered person from turning to violent means. As the wheels of progress and a demolition crew continue unabated throughout Bart&#x2019;s neighborhood, he&#x2019;s not about to give everything up without a fight.

Safer that way. It was like having a circuit breaker in his head, and it thumped into place every time part of him tried to ask: But why are you doing this? Part of his mind would go dark. Hey Georgie, who turned out the lights? Whoops, I did. Something screwy in the wiring, I guess. Just a sec. Reset the switch. The lights go back on. But the thought is gone. Everything is fine. Let us continue, Freddy&#x2014;where were we?<br> <br>He was walking to the bus stop when he saw the sign that said:<br> <br>AMMO HARVEY&#x2019;S GUN SHOP AMMO<br> <br>Remington Winchester Colt Smith &amp; Wesson<br> <br>HUNTERS WELCOME<br> <br>It was snowing a little out of a gray sky. It was the first snow of the year and it landed on the pavement like white splotches of baking soda, then melted. He saw a little boy in a red knitted cap go by with his mouth open and his tongue out to catch a flake. It&#x2019;s just going to melt, Freddy, he thought at the kid, but the kid went on anyway, with his head cocked back at the sky.<br> <br>He stopped in front of Harvey&#x2019;s Gun Shop, hesitating. There was a rack of late edition newspapers outside the door, and the headline said:<br> <br>SHAKY CEASE-FIRE HOLDS<br> <br>Below that, on the rack, was a smudged white sign that said:<br> <br>PLEASE PAY FOR YOUR PAPER!<br> <br>THIS IS AN HONOR RACK, DEALER MUST PAY<br> <br>FOR ALL PAPERS<br> <br>It was warm inside. The shop was long but not very wide. There was only a single aisle. Inside the door on the left was a glass case filled with boxes of ammunition. He recognized the .22 cartridges immediately, because he&#x2019;d had a .22 single-shot rifle as a boy in Connecticut. He had wanted that rifle for three years and when he finally got it he couldn&#x2019;t think of anything to do with it. He shot at cans for a while, then shot a blue jay. The jay hadn&#x2019;t been a clean kill. It sat in the snow surrounded by a pink blood stain, its beak slowly opening and closing. After that he had put the rifle up on hooks and it had stayed there for three years until he sold it to a kid up the street for nine dollars and a carton of funny books.<br> <br>The other ammunition was less familiar. Thirty-thirty, thirty-ought-six, and some that looked like scale-model howitzer shells. What animals do you kill with those? he wondered. Tigers? Dinosaurs? Still it fascinated him, sitting there inside the glass case like penny candy in a stationery store.<br> <br>The clerk or proprietor was talking to a fat man in green pants and a green fatigue shirt. The shirt had flap pockets. They were talking about a pistol that was lying on top of another glass case, dismembered. The fat man thumbed back the slide and they both peered into the oiled chamber. The fat man said something and the clerk or proprietor laughed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Autos always jam? You got that from your father, Mac. Admit it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Harry, you&#x2019;re full of bullshit up to your eyebrows.&#x201d;<br> <br>You&#x2019;re full of it, Fred, he thought. Right up to your eyebrows. You know it, Fred?<br> <br>Fred said he knew it.<br> <br>On the right was a glass case that ran the length of the shop. It was full of rifles on pegs. He was able to pick out the double-barreled shotguns, but everything else was a mystery to him. Yet some people&#x2014;the two at the far counter, for example&#x2014;had mastered this world as easily as he had mastered general accounting in college.<br> <br>He walked further into the store and looked into a case filled with pistols. He saw some air guns, a few .22&#x2019;s, a .38 with a wood-grip handle, .45&#x2019;s, and a gun he recognized as a .44 Magnum, the gun Dirty Harry had carried in that movie. He had heard Ron Stone and Vinnie Mason talking about that movie at the laundry, and Vinnie had said: They&#x2019;d never let a cop carry a gun like that in the city. You can blow a hole in a man a mile away with one of those.<br> <br>The fat man, Mac, and the clerk or proprietor, Harry (as in Dirty Harry), had the gun back together.<br> <br>&#x201c;You give me a call when you get that Menschler in,&#x201d; Mac said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I will&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but your prejudice against autos is irrational,&#x201d; Harry said. (He decided Harry must be the proprietor&#x2014;a clerk would never call a customer irrational.) &#x201c;Have you got to have the Cobra next week?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like it,&#x201d; Mac said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You never do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but you&#x2019;re the best goddam gunsmith in the city, and you know it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mac patted the gun on top of the glass case and turned to go. Mac bumped into him&#x2014;Watch it, Mac. Smile when you do that&#x2014;and then went on to the door. The paper was tucked under Mac&#x2019;s arm, and he could read:<br> <br>SHAKY CEA<br> <br>Harry turned to him, still smiling and shaking his head. &#x201c;Can I help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope so. But I warn you in advance, I know nothing about guns.&#x201d;<br> <br>Harry shrugged. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a law you should? Is it for someone else? For Christmas?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s just right,&#x201d; he said, seizing on it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got this cousin&#x2014;Nick, his name is. Nick Adams. He lives in Michigan and he&#x2019;s got yea guns. You know. Loves to hunt, but it&#x2019;s more than that. It&#x2019;s sort of a, well, a&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hobby?&#x201d; Harry asked, smiling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d; He had been about to say fetish. His eyes dropped to the cash register, where an aged bumper sticker was pasted on. The bumper sticker said:<br> <br>IF GUNS ARE OUTLAWED, ONLY OUTLAWS<br> <br>WILL HAVE GUNS<br> <br>He smiled at Harry and said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s very true, you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure it is,&#x201d; Harry said. &#x201c;This cousin of yours&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s kind of a one-upmanship type of thing. He knows how much I like boating and I&#x2019;ll be damned if he didn&#x2019;t up and give me an Evinrude sixty-horsepower motor last Christmas. He sent it by REA express. I gave him a hunting jacket. I felt sort of like a horse&#x2019;s ass.&#x201d;<br> <br>Harry nodded sympathetically.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I got a letter from him about six weeks ago, and he sounds just like a kid with a free pass to the circus. It seems that he and about six buddies chipped in together and bought themselves a trip to this place in Mexico, sort of like a free-fire zone&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A no-limit hunting preserve?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d; He chuckled a little. &#x201c;You shoot as much as you want. They stock it, you know. Deer, antelope, bear, bison. Everything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Was it Boca Rio?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t remember. I think the name was longer than that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Harry&#x2019;s eyes had gone slightly dreamy. &#x201c;That guy that just left and myself and two others went to Boca Rio in 1965. I shot a zebra. A goddam zebra! I got it mounted in my game room at home. That was the best time I ever had in my life, bar none. I envy your cousin.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I talked it over with my wife,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and she said go ahead. We had a very good year at the laundry. I work at the Blue Ribbon Laundry over in Western.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I know where that is.&#x201d;<br> <br>He felt that he could go on talking to Harry all day, for the rest of the year, embroidering the truth and the lies into a beautiful, gleaming tapestry. Let the world go by. Fuck the gas shortage and the high price of beef and the shaky cease-fire. Let there be talk of cousins that never were, right, Fred? Right on, Georgie.<br> <br>&#x201c;We got the Central Hospital account this year, as well as the mental institution, and also three new motels.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is the Quality Motor Court on Franklin Avenue one of yours?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve stayed there a couple of times,&#x201d; Harry said. &#x201c;The sheets were always very clean. Funny, you never think about who washes the sheets when you stay at a motel.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, we had a good year. And so I thought, maybe I can get Nick a rifle and a pistol. I know he&#x2019;s always wanted a .44 Magnum, I&#x2019;ve heard him mention that one&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Harry brought the Magnum up and laid it carefully on top of the glass case. He picked it up. He liked the heft of it. It felt like business.<br> <br>He put it back down on the glass case.<br> <br>&#x201c;The chambering on that&#x2014;&#x201d; Harry began.<br> <br>He laughed and held up a hand. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t sell me. I&#x2019;m sold. An ignoramus always sells himself. How much ammunition should I get with that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Harry shrugged. &#x201c;Get him ten boxes, why don&#x2019;t you? He can always get more. The price on that gun is two-eighty-nine plus tax, but I&#x2019;m going to give it to you for two-eighty, ammo thrown in. How&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Super,&#x201d; he said, meaning it. And then, because something more seemed required, he added: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a handsome piece.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If it&#x2019;s Boca Rio, he&#x2019;ll put it to good use.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Now the rifle&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does he have?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugged and spread his hands. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I really don&#x2019;t know. Two or three shotguns, and something he calls an auto-loader&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Remington?&#x201d; Harry asked him so quickly that he felt afraid; it was as if he had been walking in waist-deep water that had suddenly shelved off.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think it was. I could be wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Remington makes the best,&#x201d; Harry said, and nodded, putting him at ease again. &#x201c;How high do you want to go?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll be honest with you. The motor probably cost him four hundred. I&#x2019;d like to go at least five. Six hundred tops.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You and this cousin really get along, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We grew up together,&#x201d; he said sincerely. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;d give my right arm to Nick, if he wanted it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, let me show you something,&#x201d; Harry said. He picked a key out of the bundle on his ring and went to one of the glass cabinets. He opened it, climbed up on a stool, and brought down a long, heavy rifle with an inlaid stock. &#x201c;This may be a little higher than you want to go, but it&#x2019;s a beautiful gun.&#x201d; Harry handed it to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a four-sixty Weatherbee. Shoots heavier ammunition than I&#x2019;ve got here in the place right now. I&#x2019;d have to order however many rounds you wanted from Chicago. Take about a week. It&#x2019;s a perfectly weighted gun. The muzzle energy on that baby is over eight thousand pounds&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like hitting something with an airport limousine. If you hit a buck in the head with it, you&#x2019;d have to take the tail for a trophy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he said, sounding dubious even though he had decided he wanted the rifle. &#x201c;I know Nick wants trophies. That&#x2019;s part of&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure it is,&#x201d; Harry said, taking the Weatherbee and chambering it. The hole looked big enough to put a carrier pigeon in. &#x201c;Nobody goes to Boca Rio for meat. So your cousin gut-shoots. With this piece, you don&#x2019;t have to worry about tracking the goddam animal for twelve miles through the high country, the animal suffering the whole time, not to mention you missing dinner. This baby will spread his insides over twenty feet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How much?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll tell you. I can&#x2019;t move it in town. Who wants a freaking anti-tank gun when there&#x2019;s nothing to go after anymore but pheasant? And if you put them on the table, it tastes like you&#x2019;re eating exhaust fumes. It retails for nine-fifty, wholesales for six-thirty. I&#x2019;d let you have it for seven hundred.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That comes to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. almost a thousand bucks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We give a ten percent discount on orders over three hundred dollars. That brings it back to nine.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;You give that gun to your cousin, I guarantee he hasn&#x2019;t got one. If he does, I&#x2019;ll buy it back for seven-fifty. I&#x2019;ll put that in writing, that&#x2019;s how sure I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No kidding?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Absolutely. Absolutely. Of course, if it&#x2019;s too steep, it&#x2019;s too steep. We can look at some other guns. But if he&#x2019;s a real nut on the subject, I don&#x2019;t have anything else he might not have two of.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; He put a thoughtful expression on his face. &#x201c;Have you got a telephone?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure, in the back. Want to call your wife and talk it over?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think I better.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. Come on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Harry led him into a cluttered back room. There was a bench and a scarred wooden table littered with gun guts, springs, cleaning fluid, pamphlets, and labeled bottles with lead slugs in them.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s the phone,&#x201d; Harry said.<br> <br>He sat down, picked up the phone, and dialed while Harry went back to get the Magnum and put it in the box.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you for calling the WDST Weatherphone,&#x201d; the bright, recorded voice said. &#x201c;This afternoon, snow flurries developing into light snow late this evening&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, Mary?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Listen, I&#x2019;m in this place called Harvey&#x2019;s Gun Shop.

Said he&#x2019;d guarantee me Nick didn&#x2019;t have one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;by tomorrow afternoon. Lows tonight&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I love you too, Mare.

I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Harry smiled. &#x201c;What are you going to do if he sends you a Thunderbird?&#x201d;<br> <br>He smiled back. &#x201c;Return it unopened.&#x201d;<br> <br>As they walked back out Harry asked, &#x201c;Check or charge?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;American Express, if it&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good as gold.&#x201d;<br> <br>He got his card out. On the back, written on the special strip, it said:<br> <br>BARTON GEORGE DAWES<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure the shells will come in time for me to ship everything to Fred?&#x201d;<br> <br>Harry looked up from the credit blank. &#x201c;Fred?&#x201d;<br> <br>His smile expanded. &#x201c;Nick is Fred and Fred is Nick,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Nicholas Frederic Adams. It&#x2019;s kind of a joke about the name. From when we were kids.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; He smiled politely as people do when the joke is in and they are out. &#x201c;You want to sign here?&#x201d;<br> <br>He signed.<br> <br>Harry took another book out from under the counter, a heavy one with a steel chain punched through the upper left corner, near the binding. &#x201c;And your name and address here for the federals.&#x201d;<br> <br>He felt his fingers tighten on the pen. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Look at me, I never bought a gun in my life and I&#x2019;m mad.&#x201d; He wrote his name and address in the book:<br> <br>Barton George Dawes 1241 Crestallen Street West<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re into everything,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is nothing to what they&#x2019;d like to do,&#x201d; Harry said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know. You know what I heard on the news the other day? They want a law that says a guy riding on a motorcycle has to wear a mouth protector. A mouth protector, for God&#x2019;s sake.

She sent me a bouquet, so says the letter carrier.</p><p>Now, I much want a correspondent in Richmond, one who will write me of course without name or description of the writer, and she need only incur the risk of dropping an ordinary letter by flag of truce in the Post Office at Richmond, directed to a name at the North. Her messenger thinks Miss Van Lieu will be glad to do it.</p><p>I can place my first and only letter in her hands for her directions, but I also place the man&#x2019;s life in her hands who delivers the letter. Is it safe so to do? Will Miss Van Lieu be willing to either correspond herself or find me such a correspondent? I could pay large rewards, but from what I hear of her I should prefer not to do it, as I think she would be actuated to do what she does by patriotic motives only.</p><p>I wish therefore you would write me, confidentially&#x2014;�and as so much is depending, in the strictest secrecy, what you think of the matter.

Butler</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><br></p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p>The Van Lew mansion in Richmond&#x2019;s fashionable Church Hill neighborhood had not hosted a wedding gala in many a year, and if the bride-�to-�be did not emerge from her attic bedroom soon, Lizzie feared it might not that day either.</p><p>Turning away from the staircase, Lizzie resisted the urge to check her engraved pocket watch for the fifth time in as many minutes and instead stepped outside onto the side portico, abandoning the mansion to her family, servants, and the apparently bashful bridal party ensconced in the servants&#x2019; quarters. Surely Mary Jane wasn't having second thoughts. She adored Wilson Bowser, and just that morning she had declared him the most excellent man of her acquaintance. A young woman in love would not leave such a man standing at the altar.</p><p>Perhaps Mary Jane was merely nervous, or a button had come off her gown, or her flowers were not quite perfect. As hostess, Lizzie ought to go and see, but a strange reluctance held her back. Earlier that morning, when Mary Jane&#x2019;s friends had arrived&#x2014;�young women of color like Mary Jane herself, some enslaved, some free&#x2014;�Lizzie had felt awkward and unwanted among them, a sensation unfamiliar and particularly unsettling to experience in her own home. None of the girls had spoken impudently to her, but after greeting her politely they had encircled Mary Jane and led her off to her attic bedroom, turning their backs upon Lizzie as if they had quite forgotten she was there. And so she was left to wait, alone and increasingly curious.</p><p>Grasping the smooth, whitewashed railing, Lizzie gazed out upon the sun-�splashed gardens, where the alluring fragrance of magnolia drifted on the balmy air above the neatly pruned hedgerows. Across the street, a shaft of sunlight bathed the steeple of Saint John&#x2019;s Church in a rosy glow like a benediction from heaven, blessing the bride and groom, blessing the vows they would soon take. It was a perfect spring day in Richmond, the sort of April morning that inspired bad poetry and impulsive declarations of affection best kept to oneself. Lizzie could almost forget that not far away, in the heart of the city, a furious debate was raging, a searing prelude to the vote that would determine whether her beloved Virginia would follow the Southern cotton states out of the fragmenting nation.</p><p>Despite the clamor and frenzy that had surged in Richmond in the weeks leading up to the succession convention, Lizzie staunchly believed that reason, pragmatism, and loyalty would triumph in the end. Union�ist delegates outnumbered secessionist fire-�eaters two to one, and Vir�ginians were too proud of their heritage as the birthplace of Washington, Jefferson, and Madison to leave the nation their honored forebears had founded.</p><p>Still, she had to admit that John Lewis&#x2019;s increasing pessimism troubled her. Mr. Lewis, a longtime family friend serving as a delegate from Rockingham County, had been the Van Lews&#x2019; guest throughout the convention, and his ominous reports of shouting matches erupting in closed sessions made her uneasy. So too did the gathering of a splinter group of adamant secessionists only a block and a half away from the Capitol, although outwardly she made light of the so-�called Spontaneous People&#x2019;s Convention. &#x201c;How can a convention be both spontaneous and arranged well in advance, with time for the sending and accepting of invitations?&#x201d; she had mocked, but the tentative, worried smiles her mother and brother had given her in reply were but a small reward.</p><p>Although Lizzie managed such shows of levity of time to time, she could not ignore the disquieting signs that the people of Richmond were declaring themselves for the Confederacy in ever greater numbers. Less than a week before, when word reached the city of the Union gar�rison&#x2019;s surrender at Fort Sumter in Charleston, neighbors and strangers alike had thronged into the streets, shouting and crying and flinging their hats into the air. Impromptu parades had formed and bands had played spirited renditions of &#x201c;Dixie&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Marseillaise.&#x201d; Down by the riverside at the Tredegar Iron Works, thousands had cheered as a newly cast cannon fired off a thunderous salute to the victors. Lizzie had been dismayed to see, waving here and there above the heads of the crowd, home-�sewn flags boasting the South Carolina palmetto or the three stripes and seven stars of the Confederacy. But when the crowd marched to the governor&#x2019;s mansion, instead of giving them the speech they demanded, John Letcher urged them to all go home.</p><p>Lizzie had been heartened by the governor&#x2019;s refusal to cower before the mob, and she prayed that his example would help other wavering Unionists find their courage and remember their duty. But two days later, word came to Richmond that President Lincoln had called for seventy-�five thousand militia to put down the rebellion&#x2014;�and Virginia would be required to provide her share. Many Virginians who had been ambivalent about secession until then had become outraged by the president&#x2019;s demand that they go to war against their fellow Southerners, and they defiantly joined the clamor of voices shouting for Virginia to leave the Union. John Minor Botts, a Whig and perhaps the most outspoken and steadfast Unionist in Richmond politics, had called the mobilization proclamation &#x201c;the most unfortunate state paper that ever issued from any executive since the establishment of the government.&#x201d;</p><p>But would it prove to be the straw that broke the camel&#x2019;s back? Lizzie could not allow herself to believe it.</p><p>&#x201c;Rational men will not cave in to the demands of the mob,&#x201d; Lizzie had argued to Mr. Lewis that very morning. Like herself, he was a Virginia native, born in 1818, and a Whig. Unlike her, he was married, had children, and could vote. &#x201c;They will heed the demands of their consciences and the law.&#x201d;</p><p>A few crumbs of Hannah&#x2019;s light, buttery biscuits fell free from Mr. Lewis&#x2019;s dark beard as he shook his head. &#x201c;A man who fears for his life may be willing to consider a different interpretation of the law.&#x201d;</p><p>At that, a shadow of worry had passed over Mother&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mean there have been threats of violence?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It pains me to distress you, but indeed, yes, and almost daily,&#x201d; Mr. Lewis had replied. &#x201c;Those of us known to be faithful to the Union run a gauntlet of insults, abuse, and worse whenever we enter or depart the Capitol.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Goodness.&#x201d; Mother had shuddered and hunched her thin shoulders as if warding off an icy wind. Petite and elegant, with gray eyes and an enviably fair complexion even at almost sixty-�three years of age, she was ever the thoughtful hostess. &#x201c;You must allow us to send Peter and William along with you from now on. They will see to your safety.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Madam, but I must decline. I won&#x2019;t allow my enemies to believe they'veintimidated me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When the vote is called, wiser heads will prevail,&#x201d; Lizzie had insisted, as much to reassure herself and Mother as to persuade Mr. Lewis. &#x201c;Virginians are too proud a people to let bullies rule the day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As you say, Miss Van Lew. Nothing would please me more than to be proven wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>Remembering his somber words, Lizzie gazed off to the west toward the political heart of the city, scarcely seeing the historic church, the gracious homes, and the well-�tended gardens arrayed so beautifully before her. Instead she imagined the view from the Capitol gallery, where she had often sat and observed the machinery of government, and she wished she could be there to witness the contentious debate for herself. Of course, that was not possible. The gallery had been shut to visitors for the closed session, and Lizzie could not miss Mary Jane&#x2019;s wedding. She could only wait for news and hope that her faith in the men of Virginia had not been misplaced.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p><br></p></p><h2>Sticks Across the Chimney--a Story of Denmark , By Nora Burglon</h2><p>Sticks Across the Chimney--a Story of Denmark , By Nora Burglon</p><p></p><h2>Grandpa&#39;s secret (Christopher Churchmouse classics)</h2><p>Children&#39;s book</p><p></p><h2>Old Man of the Sea (Lantana Global Picture Books)</h2><p><p>Every Sunday, Grandpa waited for me in his room, and I took my place at the foot of the bed.

'Every line on my skin tells the story of my life,' Grandpa tells his narrating grandson before he begins sharing his life's story. With the help of Santiago's striking illustrations, Elia shows this old salt's love for each land he visited in his youth as a sailor.

From Asia to Oceania and finally America, Santiago's vibrant palette depicts famous landmarks and animals in each of the five continents (North and South America are considered as one, and Antarctica doesn't make an appearance). With a touch of the fantastical, the narrative carries readers over the oceans as Grandpa's ship rides the hump of a whale from continent to continent and Grandpa collects stories.

In the first five pages, readers encounter a gay-bashing incident, a patient dying of AIDS and activists wearing Queer Nation T-shirts.But the punch and distinctive voice of the earlier books are diminished here: it's as if Stevenson is overly concerned with political statements. Fearing for his life, writer/activist John Rutka--determinedly engaged in "outing" prominent citizens--retains Strachey when a bullet grazes his foot, but Strachey abandons the case when he suspects that the incident was staged. Soon our hero has a real mystery on his hands: Rutka is found dead, and any number of people might have cheerfully dispatched him. Rutka's files point to a particularly sinister closeted homosexual whom Strachey must unmask. Though the book's final third shifts into gear, it's not high enough; if a polemic was intended, the fuel gauge reads "low." At one point Strachey is "weary of all the secrecy and duplicity and dreary bitchery"--more of those very qualities might have at least jazzed up this rather pallid effort. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A thousand Sundays: The story of the Ed Sullivan show</h2><p>Dust Jacket in Very Good condition.</p><p></p><h2>The Sailing Bible: The Complete Guide for All Sailors, from Novice to Expert</h2><p><p> <i>"Sailing is a popular sport and this book is a very comprehensive treatment of the subject....

It offers great value for all those who want to enjoy the wonderfully simple sensations of being blown along by a breeze in your sails. This book - arranged in the following sections - aims to tell you everything you need to know about this great sport.</p> <p>Starting out<br> How did sailing evolve from tough working boats and millionaires' yachts to a sport enjoyed by millions of sailors today? Democracy and technology have taken over, providing an activity that can be enjoyed by all ages at all levels, ranging from recreational to professional. The first section of this book explains how you can learn to sail and get into the sport, and provides a guide to the similarities and differences between sailing small dinghies, larger keelboats, multihulls or larger cruising yachts.</p> <p>Learning to sail<br> How does the wind actually drive a boat? In the old days, it was simple: the crew of a Viking long ship or square-rigger merely sailed with the wind behind them, but now we can sail in any direction except directly toward the wind. This section explains the difference between "points" of sailing known as beating, reaching and running, and the changes in direction known as tacks and jibes. It goes on to cover how sail power provides forward drive and how sail trim and the rudder are used to steer the boat.<br> Sailing maneuvers involve changing direction, not least when you meet another boat, so a vital question is "Who has right of way?" Knots and ropework are also basic elements of learning to sail, as are staying warm and choosing the right gear.<br> </p><p>Dinghy sailing<br> Dinghies and beach cats are the smallest sailing craft. They also provide the cheapest introduction to the sport and get you physically closer to wind and water. The choice of different boats is huge, so in this section we have made a selection of popular classes, explaining how they are designed and built, and how you launch and sail away from the shore. You'll find details here about all of these, plus information on racing around a course, dinghy maintenance, and trapeze and spinnaker technique for high-performance sailing.<br></p> <p>Cruiser sailing<br> A cruiser or yacht provides the opportunity to live afloat. It's a wonderful lifestyle, whether you're sailing in sunshine or snuggled up somewhere in the comfort of the cabin down below. This section explains the principal elements of a cruiser, how to rig and reef the sails, how to sail in all directions, how to use the engine should the wind fail, how to leave or enter a dock or marina, how to deal with wind and tide, and how to choose an anchorage or pick up a mooring. It also explains what to do in rough weather or fog.<br> Remember that you'll want to go ashore, so you'll need a tender - also covered in this section.<br></p> Navigation and weather<br> You need to know where you're going and how to get there. Navigation was once a difficult subject, but has become much more accessible due to the availability of GPS. The classic style of navigation, however, is still important - everyone who sails a yacht should know how to read a chart, plot a course and calculate the movement of tides. Weather plays a major role in sailing, and though we have never been more blessed by reliable forecasts, understanding weather systems and their effect on your sailing will be an invaluable help.<br> <p>Boat maintenance<br> Many dinghies are virtually maintenance free: just hose off any salt and put them away. By contrast, yachts require annual maintenance to ensure that everything works perfectly the following season. This section explains how to look after every element of the yacht including the hull and deck, sails, engine, electrical, plumbing and safety equipment.<br></p> <p> Safety<br> Finally, you need to sail safely, To do this, you must plan ahead, use the right equipment, avoid collisions, learn how to read signals and acquire a basic knowledge of first aid and emergency repairs.<br></p> <p>We hope you enjoy this book and that it leads to many years of sailing pleasure. It truly is a fabulous sport.</p></p><h2>Undying Glory: The Story of the Massachusetts 54th Regiment</h2><p>A look back at the African Americans who fought for the Union Army during the Civil War describes how, despite the fact that they were treated like second-class soldiers, the men proved their courage in battle.

While the dramatic events involving this famous couple may be familiar, this fascinating book provides a fresh look at their lives through the extraordinary collection of private photographs recently discovered in the Windsor residence in Paris, many of which have never been published before. In 1986 Mohammed Al Fayed, who revitalized two venerable institutions, Harrods in London and the Ritz Hotel in Paris, purchased the Paris mansion that had been the last home of the Duke and Duchess; he also acquired the contents of the house. As the residence was being restored, a few photographs emerged from drawers and chests, together with old scrapbooks, newspaper clippings, and other mementos of the couple&#39;s life together. But it was not until 1988 that the mahogany lid covering the bathtub in the Duke&#39;s bathroom was lifted to reveal the most exciting find - an additional hoard of some ten thousand photographs. The staff had hidden the pictures in the bathtub to keep them safe from acquisitive visitors during the Duchess&#39;s long illness, when many private papers were disappearing from the house. The photographs range from family snapshots to formal portraits by such well-known photographers as Cecil Beaton and Karsh of Ottawa. This remarkable cache of photographs, scrapbooks, and other objects from the house reveal the Windsors&#39; very different backgrounds - the Duke as a royal prince, brought up to be heir to a worldwide empire, the Duchess growing up in anunremarkable family in Baltimore. The photographs show them as young adults, portray their romance, and reveal their thirty-five years of married life in exile following the Abdication.When the Duchess of Windsor died in 1986, the lease of her Paris villa, near the Bois de Boulogne, and its contents had to be disposed of. Along came Mohamed Al Fayed, the Egyptian-born owner of Harrods, "the international businessman and philanthropist" who had already bought and refurbished the Paris Ritz. This sumptuous selection of photographs from the collections of the ex-king and his duchess, flanked by others of the restored house actually owned by the city of Paris, is a dual biography of the expatriate pair with the harsh edges softened, and a public relations exercise for Mohamed Al Fayed. Voyeurs of English royalty will be transfixed, as many of the photos are unfamiliar and often brilliantly reproduced, although in no sense historically significant. The text, by the author of lives of Cecil Beaton and Greta Garbo, retells the familiar tale of the aging playboy king who relinquished his crown for the ambitious, twice-divorced American. Their prewar fling with the Nazis and their lengthy life in exile are handled with loyal tact. Following the social seasons and migrations with Wallis and Edward, punctuated by their brief meetings with such postwar figures as President Nixon and Generalissimo Franco's son-in-law, proves dull viewing, especially when accompanied by lifeless prose. The net effect, emphasized by the 400 illustrations, is one of expensive but uninspired lives. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Pope&#39;s War: Why Ratzinger&#39;s Secret Crusade Has Imperiled the Church and How It Can Be Saved</h2><p><i>The Pope's War</i> offers a provocative look at three decades of corruption in the Catholic Church, focusing on Josef Ratzinger, Pope Benedict XVI.<br>Matthew Fox presents insights from his 12-year, up-close-and-personal battle with Ratzinger, tracing the historical roots of degradation in the Church and offering a new way to understand why Benedict XVI is now mired in crisis as Pope.

Whether the boy is a modern-day Huck Finn or not, Trinity Harbor is in an uproar. But for Daisy, guiding the orphaned ten-year-old is easy, an escape from her own tragic past.

But to Walker, Daisy is a disconcerting mix of charming innocence and smart-mouthed excitement in a town that's not as sleepy as it looks. <br><br></p><p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina. Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.<br><br>Daisy Spencer had always wanted children. She just hadn't expected to wind up stealing one.<br><br>Okay, that was a slight exaggeration. She hadn't exactly stolen Tommy Flanagan. The way she saw it, nobody wanted the boy. His father was long gone and his pitiful, frail mother had had the misfortune to die in the recent flu epidemic. The story was the talk of Trinity Harbor and had been for weeks now.<br><br>While they searched for relatives, Social Services had placed Tommy with three different foster families in as many weeks, but Tommy wouldn't stay put. He was scared and angry and about as receptive to love as that vicious old rooster Daisy's father insisted on keeping over at Cedar Hill.<br><br>Despite all that, Daisy's heart just about broke when she thought of all the pain that ten-year-old had gone through. She figured she had more than enough love to spare for the little boy who'd been one of her brightest Sunday school students, a boy who was suddenly all alone in the world, a boy who'd lost his faith in God on the day his mother died.<br><br>Daisy's own faith had been tested half a dozen years ago when she'd been told she would never have children of her own. The news had almost destroyed her. It <em>had </em>destroyed her relationship with Billy Inscoe, the only man she'd ever loved.<br><br>All Daisy had cared about was having children she could shower with love. Adoption would have suited her just fine.<br><br>But Billy hadn't been able to see beyond the fact that his fianc�e was barren. Billy had wanted sons and daughters of his own. He'd wanted his blood running through their veins, proof of his manhood running through the streets. He'd wanted to start a dynasty as proud as the Spencers'. When Daisy couldn't give him that, he'd taken back his ring and gone looking for someone who could.<br><br>With the exception of Daisy's minister, nobody knew the truth about what had happened between her and Billy. Daisy kept quiet because she'd been so humiliated by the discovery that she wasn't woman enough to give Billy what he thought he needed from a wife. Billy had been discreet for his own reasons.<br><br>Her own father thought the broken engagement was the result of some whim on her part, as if she'd turned her back on marriage because she thought someone better might be waiting around the next corner. He couldn't conceive of the possibility that his handpicked choice for her had been the one to walk out, and Daisy had let him have his illusions.<br><br>And so, until this morning Daisy had pretty much considered her dream of a family dead and buried, right along with every bit of respect and love she'd ever felt for Billy Inscoe.<br><br>The last few years she'd thrown herself into her job teaching history at the local high school. She was advisor for the yearbook, the drama club and the 4-H. She taught Sunday school classes. She took her friends' children fishing on the banks of the Potomac River and on outings to Stratford Hall, the birthplace of Robert E. Lee, or Wakefield, the birthplace of George Washington, both of which were nearby. She gardened, nurturing flowers and vegetables the way she'd always wanted to nurture her own babies.<br><br>Heaven help her, she'd even brought home a cat for company, though the independent Molly spent precious little time with her mistress unless she was hungry. And as if to mock Daisy, she'd just had her second litter of kittens.<br><br>In another era, Daisy would have been labeled a boring spinster, even though she'd barely turned thirty. Frankly, there were times when that was exactly what she felt like: a dull, dried-up old lady. The role she'd always envisioned herself playing&#x2014;wife and mother&#x2014;seemed totally beyond her grasp. She was on the verge of resigning herself to living on the fringes of other people's lives, to being Aunt Daisy once her brothers married and had families of their own.<br><br>Today, though, everything had changed. Early this morning she'd gone to the garage and found Tommy, cold and shivering in the spring chill. He'd been wearing a pair of filthy jeans, a sweater that had been claimed from the church thrift shop even though it was two sizes too big and a pair of sneakers that were clearly too small for his growing feet. His blond hair was matted beneath a Baltimore Orioles baseball cap, and his freckles seemed to stand out even more than usual against his pale complexion.<br><br>Despite the sorry state he was in, the boy had been scared and defiant and distrustful. But eventually she'd been able to talk him into coming inside, where she'd fixed him a breakfast of eggs, bacon, hash browns, grits and toast. He'd devoured it all as if he were half-starved, all the while watching her warily. Only in the last few minutes had Tommy slowed down. He was pushing the last of his eggs around on his plate as if fearful of what might happen once he was done.<br><br>Studying him, for the first time in years Daisy felt a stirring of excitement. Her prayers had been answered. She felt alive, as if she finally had a mission. Mothering this boy was something she'd been meant to do. And she intended to cling to that sensation with everything in her. Even Molly seemed to agree. She'd been purring and rubbing against Tommy since he'd arrived.<br><br>"I ain't going to another foster home," Tommy declared, allowing his fork to clatter against his plate in emphasis.<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>He regarded her suspiciously. "You ain't gonna make me?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"How come?"<br><br>"Because I intend to let you stay right here, at least until things settle down." Even as she said the words, she realized she'd made the decision the minute she'd seen him.<br><br>His gaze narrowed. "Settle down how?"<br><br>Daisy wasn't sure of that herself. Her heart had opened up the instant she discovered Tommy in her garage, but she was smart enough to know that she couldn't just decide to keep him. Frances Jackson over at Social Services was looking for relatives, and there were probably a thousand other legalities to consider. All Daisy knew was that if she had anything at all to say about it, this boy had run away for the last time. Maybe for once, being a Spencer would be a blessing. People might like to gossip about the family, but they tended to bow to their wishes.<br><br>"You'll just have to trust me," she said eventually.<br><br>He scowled at that. "Don't know why I should."<br><br>She hid a grin, wondering what made her think this smart-mouthed kid was a gift from above.<br><br>She gave him a stern look. "Because I have been your Sunday school teacher since you were a toddler, Tommy Flanagan, and I don't lie."<br><br>"Never said you did," he mumbled. "Just don't know why I should think you're any different than all those other people who promised I'd get to stay, then kicked me out."<br><br>"Nobody kicked you out. You keep running away," she reminded him. "Isn't that right?"<br><br>He shrugged off the distinction. "I suppose."<br><br>"Why did you do that?"<br><br>"They just took me in because they had to. I know when I'm not wanted. I just made it easy for 'em."<br><br>"Okay, then, for however long it takes to find your family&#x2014;or forever, if it comes to that&#x2014;you are going to have a home right here with me. And I'm going to see to it that you don't have any reason to want to run away. Don't take that to mean I'm going to be a pushover, though."<br><br>She said it emphatically and without the slightest hesitation. Her gaze locked with his. "Do we have an understanding?"<br><br>"I guess," he said, apparently satisfied for the moment that she meant what she said.<br><br>Relief washed through her. This was going to work out. She could feel it. Daisy didn't even consider the fact that she'd caught him trying to hot-wire her car as a bad omen. Hopefully Tommy wouldn't mention that little detail to anyone. She certainly didn't intend to.<br><br>She did worry ever so slightly about the repercussions once word got back to her father, but she was convinced she could handle that, too. She just hoped it would take the grapevine a little longer than usual to reach Cedar Hill. King wasn't as easily won over as a scared kid.<br><br>In the meantime, she knew she did have to call Frances Jackson. Frances took her job at Social Services very seriously. Tommy's disappearances were wearing on her nerves. Daisy reached for the portable phone.<br><br>"Who're you calling?" Tommy demanded, scowling.<br><br>"Mrs. Jackson. She needs to know that you're with me and that you're okay."<br><br>"Don't see why." He gave her a pleading look. "Couldn't we just keep this between us? You tell her, and the next thing we know she'll have the sheriff over here hauling my butt away."<br><br>"The sheriff won't lay a hand on you," Daisy reassured him fiercely, but she put the phone back on the table.<br><br>"How come?"<br><br>"Because the sheriff is my brother and he'll do what I tell him to do." At least she hoped he would.<br><br>Tommy still looked skeptical. "Have you got something on him?"<br><br>Daisy chuckled. "Not the way you mean. Just leave handling Tucker to me. It won't be a problem. Besides, when you go back to school on Monday, people are going to want to know where you're staying. We might as well be up-front about it."<br><br>"I thought maybe I wouldn't go back," he said, looking hopeful. "It's almost summer, anyway."<br><br>"Not a chance," Daisy said firmly. "Education is too important&#x2014;you can't take it lightly. And there are weeks to go before summer, not days. You will go to school and that's that. Now go on upstairs, Tommy, take a bath and then get a little rest. I'm sure you didn't sleep much last night. There are clean towels in the closet, and you can have the guest room at the end of the hall. If you need anything, just ask. We'll talk some more later."<br><br>Tommy nodded and started out of the kitchen, then paused. "How come you're being so nice to me?"<br><br>For an instant he allowed her to see the vulnerable, lost little boy behind the defiant facade. "Because you're worth being nice to, Tommy Flanagan," she told him.<br><br>He seemed a bit startled by that, but he gave a little bob of his head and took off, thundering up the stairs, Molly trailing after him.<br><br>"And because I need you as much as you need me," she whispered when he was out of earshot.<br><br>Once again she reached for the phone and made the call to Frances.<br><br>"Oh, Daisy," the social worker murmured when she'd heard what Daisy had to say. "Are you sure you want to do this? Tommy's a real troublemaker. Not that it's not understandable, given what he's been through, but he needs a firm hand."<br><br>"He needs love," Daisy retorted. "And I intend to see that he gets it."<br><br>"But&#x2014;"<br><br>"Is there some reason I'm not a fit foster mother for him?" Daisy demanded.<br><br>"Of course not," Frances said, as if the very idea that someone would consider a Spencer unfit was ludicrous.<br><br>"Then that's that. Tommy stays here."<br><br>"Until I find a relative," the social worker reminded her.<br><br>"Or not," Daisy said. "You'll take care of the paperwork, then?"<br><br>Frances sighed. "I will. I'll drop it by later for you to sign, though I can't imagine what King is going to say when he hears about this."<br><br>"Then you be real sure not to tell him," Daisy retorted. "Or I'll make him think this was all your idea."<br><br>Frances was still sputtering over the threat when Daisy hung up. A little grin of satisfaction spread across her face. It was about time she gave the residents of Trinity Harbor something to talk about besides her long-ago broken engagement and her pecan pie.<br><br>"Sis, you are out of your ever-loving mind," her brother Tucker, the local sheriff, told Daisy when he arrived within an hour of her conversation with Frances.<br><br>Obviously the instant he'd heard what she was up to&#x2014;probably straight from the social worker&#x2014;Tucker had hightailed it over to lecture her as if she were sixteen instead of thirty. Hands on hips, he was scowling at her as if she'd committed some sort of crime, instead of simply seizing the opportunity that had been presented to her.<br><br>"That boy's going to land in juvenile detention," he declared in his best doom-and-gloom tone. "You mark my words. Doc's caught him stealing comic books. He broke Mrs. Thomas's window. And he rode his bike through Mr. Lindsey's bean patch and mowed down most of his plants. Something tells me that's just the things we know about. There could be more. He's headed for trouble, Daisy."<br><br>Daisy stared right straight back into Tucker's eyes, ignored his stony expression, and countered, "Well, of course he is...unless someone steps in and does something."<br><br>"And that has to be you?"<br><br>"Do you see anybody else who's willing?" she demanded. "He's already run through half the foster families in the area. As for those pranks of his, you and Bobby did worse and nobody did more than call Daddy to complain."<br><br>"That was different."<br><br>"How?"<br><br>Tucker squirmed uneasily. "It just was, that's all." He tried another tack. "When Dad hears about this, he is going to go ballistic."<br><br>She shrugged off her brother's assessment as if it was of no consequence. "Dad is always going ballistic about one thing or another. Usually it's you or Bobby who gets him all worked up. It's about time I took a turn. Being King Spencer's dutiful daughter is starting to wear thin."<br><br>"You'll get your heart broken," Tucker predicted, his expression worried. "You can't just take in some stray kid and decide to keep him. That's no way to get what you want, Sis."<br><br>Her big brother knew better than anyone how desperately she wanted a family. He had been the one to console her when Billy had walked out, leaving her convinced she would never marry. Even without knowing anything more than the fact that Billy was the one to break the engagement, Tucker had wanted to throttle the man. Daisy had persuaded him not to, assuring him that Billy Inscoe wasn't worth another second of their time, much less the risk of an assault charge that could ruin Tucker's career in law enforcement.<br><br>"Sooner or later, they'll find Tommy's family," Tucker warned, regarding her protectively.<br><br>"I don't know what makes you so certain of that," she said. "There's been no sign of anyone so far, and you know how dogged Frances is when she's working a case."<br><br>"That's exactly what makes me believe she'll eventually get results. When she does, you'll have to let him go."<br><br>"And until then, he'll have me," she insisted stubbornly, not wanting to consider what she would do when that day came.<br><br>"Where is he now?" Tucker asked.<br><br>"Upstairs."<br><br>"Cleaning out your jewelry box, no doubt."<br><br>She scowled. "Sleeping," she contradicted.<br><br>"Wanna bet? If I prove otherwise, will you forget about this?"<br><br>Without responding one way or the other, Daisy marched to the stairs, then waved Tucker up ahead of her. "See for yourself, smarty-pants."<br><br></p><h2>The myth of analysis: Three essays in archetypal psychology</h2><p>In this work, acclaimed Jungian James Hillman examines the concepts of myth, insights, eros, body, and the mytheme of female inferiority, as well as the need for the freedom to imagine and to feel psychic reality. By examining these ideas, and the role they have played both in and outside of the therapeutic setting, Hillman mounts a compelling argument that, rather than locking them away in some inner asylum or subjecting them to daily self-treatment, man's "peculiarities" can become an integral part of a rich and fulfilling daily life.<br><br>Originally published by Northwestern University Press in 1972, this work had a profound impact on a nation emerging self-aware from the 1960s, as well as on the era's burgeoning feminist movement. It remains a profound critique of therapy and the psychological viewpoint, and it is one of Hillman's most important and enduring works.<br></p><p><p>James Hillman (April 12, 1926 &#x2013; October 27, 2011) was an American psychologist. He studied at, and then guided studies for, the C.G. Jung Institute in Zurich, founded a movement toward archetypal psychology and retired into private practice, writing and traveling to lecture, until his death at his home in Connecticut on October 27, 2011.</p></p><h2>After God&#39;s Heart: A Bible Study for Women on Loving and Obeying God from 1 Samuel</h2><p><p><b>What does it mean to be a woman after God's heart?</b><br><br> Do you desire to be closer to God? Do you feel as if you know Him, but He&#x2019;s so far away? The hustle and bustle of life can make it easy to turn away from your Bible and toward the next trend. But while the whole world is chasing success, God is giving us an invitation to sit with Him in an intimate space. It&#x2019;s in those quiet moments that we learn who He is. Naturally, we begin to reflect Him in our everyday lives. And before we know it, we&#x2019;re seeking out His will over our own. Explore 1 Samuel to discover what it means to be a woman after God&#x2019;s heart and gain practical application for your life.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>How will you love and obey a God you can't see, hear, or touch? You can start by taking a look at the old testament book of 1 Samuel. The narrative of 1 Samuel is far more than a compelling true story. It shows God in action.</p> <p>In this 13-lesson study, Bible teacher Myrna Alexander introduces us to people who grew in faith by applying their knowledge of God to their daily circumstances. We see real people--Hannah, Samuel, David, Jonathan--as they wrestled with godly principles and&nbsp;human temptations. They&nbsp;cared enough about God to follow His commands and thus became living definitions of what it means to be after God's heart.</p> <p>The Bible reveals what God loves, but that often differs from what human beings value. Humanity praises externals and makes performance the&nbsp;criterion for success; God is concerned with heart attitudes. As in biblical days, the eyes of God search the earth for people whose hearts resonate with His.</p> <p>Join Myrna Alexander in studying the practical encouraging book of 1 Samuel and allow God's Word to align your heart with His.</p>Myrna Alexander is in demand as a speaker at women&#39;s conferences and has taught women&#39;s Bible study classes in the U.S. and Europe.

Translated from the French and with an introduction by Margaret Crosland. Drawings by the author. 133 pages. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 89-73273. Ochre boards with green cloth spine and gold gilt lettering on spine. 8 3/4 x 5 3/4 in.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)Written in 1929, this is the great metaphysical painter's only novel. Though it is a rare example of surrealistic prose, De Chirico had, by the time he wrote it, rejected surrealism in painting and embraced a metaphysical classicism. The result is an original blending of styles, a series of vignettes and visions, surprisingly fresh after six decades, written with complete disdain for time and space. The eponymous Hebdomeros remembers, imagines and experiences images and events: he describes gods and innkeepers; is horrified of gastronomes ("he considered strawberries and figs the most immoral fruits"); attacks fashionable artists ("the living and walking symbol of human stupidity"); and invents scenarios that are often more like those of Lewis Carroll than of Huysmans or Homer. With subjects ranging from the thrill of everyday objects and sensations to the story of the prodigal son, De Chirico leaps wildly from non sequitur"Hebdomeros had never thought of associating the idea of hangovers with that of fish"to bizarre conceptions of "eternal noon." Replete with hallmark melancholy, foreboding and Freudian imageryclose, in fact, to a prose translation of De Chirico's early work on canvasHebdomeros is a fascinating look into a creative mind.

Diane Fry, Ben's new partner, is an ambitious woman who's just been transferred to the Edendale force. She's jealous of Ben's familiarity with the locals, who won't tell her anything but treat Ben like a beloved son. The pair is teamed up to investigate the brutal murder of a 15-year-old girl whose parents, like Fry, are outsiders. The old man who finds Laura Vernon's body is an enigmatic, close-mouthed man who obviously knows more than he's telling, but even Ben can't budge Harry Dickinson from his determination to keep the real story of what happened in the dark woods of England's brooding Peak District to himself. Laura's father is anxious to pin the crime on a local boy who may have had sexual designs on her and who's conveniently gone missing. But the search for the killer turns up the dark secrets of the Vernons as well as a number of other suspects who keep Ben and Diane guessing until the last page of this well-written, carefully paced, and deeply atmospheric novel. A strong first showing from a writer worth watching, with a protagonist who'd be good company in a return engagement. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>Stephen Booth</b> was born in Lancashire, England, and brought up in Blackpool.

Mama is always there, and us twins, many of the Strickland-Garcia-Redmonds, and anywhere from half a dozen to forty of the Broussard clan. It&#x2019;s a little stressful for him. You&#x2019;d think that after all this time he&#x2019;d be used to it, but then you don&#x2019;t know our father.</p><p>The bubble will vanish, and there he&#x2019;ll be, a short man built like a fireplug, white hair and beard, interrupted in the middle of a Hail Mary. He&#x2019;ll stop, look around to be sure he&#x2019;s not surrounded by green slime monsters from Betelgeuse this time, and when he sees all those familiar faces, his own craggy features will split into a huge grin and his Santa Claus eyes will twinkle, and he&#x2019;ll shout, <i>&#x201c;Laissez les bons temps rouler!&#x201d; </i>And then the good times <i>will</i> roll, <i>cher</i>.</p><p>This time was different. He looked around, he started to smile, and suddenly his eyes grew wide. There was a momentary pause as a look of horror slowly spread across his face, and he shouted:</p><p><i>&#x201c;Stop the ship!&#x201d;</i></p><p>Well, that&#x2019;s easy to say, a little harder to do.</p><p>The ship he was talking about was the <i>Rolling Thunder</i>, our home.

That&#x2019;s not even counting our own 123 pounds times two.</p><p>And she was traveling at just about .77c, last time we checked.</p><p>That&#x2019;s 143,220 miles per second, or 515 million miles per hour, fast enough to get from Old Sun&#x2014;a medium-sized G-type star that warms the planet where humans evolved, or so we are told&#x2014;to Mars&#x2014;where our mother was born&#x2014;in about sixteen minutes.</p><p>Trust us, at that speed and with that mass, you don&#x2019;t just grab for the brake handle.</p><p>If anyone else had said it, everyone would have written it off as insanity, temporary or permanent.</p><p>But Papa is Jubal Broussard, and when Jubal talks, people listen.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Polly:</p><p>I was lining up a sure shot on the nine ball, not thirty meters away, when a Hillbilly came soaring up beneath me and tore off part of my starboard wing.</p><p>Next thing I knew I was on my back, looking up at her big ass in its tight scarlet-and-mustard-striped jumper, and her smirking face looking back over her shoulder.</p><p>I recognized her at once. It was Cheryl Chang, girl gorilla. She was so hefty you just had to wonder at first how she could get her flycycle in the air. Then you saw those huge hams and thick arms and bull neck and it became clear: brute power trumped her outsize mass. There was no finesse in her cycling. I don&#x2019;t think she had scored a pocket all season, but that wasn&#x2019;t her job. She was the intimidator, the one you had to always look out for, because she was somehow able to spring out of nowhere and make you sorry you were in the air. She and I had tangled before, but never so badly.</p><p>Skypool is a full-contact sport, and I&#x2019;m not a crybaby, but it was a flagrant foul and I shouted some words that would have blistered her butt if words could do physical damage, and looked around for a zebra. Naturally, all three refs were on other sides of the field, one near the up pocket and two arguing over some fine point of the last score at the east pocket. Cheryl would have checked their positions before she hit me.</p><p>And there I was, hanging out pretty much alone, within scoring distance of the bottom pocket.</p><p>But it didn&#x2019;t take long for me to realize that a missed penalty was the least of my problems. I was going to have a hard time staying in the game at all.</p><p>BLINKLINK: SKYPOOL: A game played in zero gee, invented in the starship Rolling Thunder, late twenty-first century. Eight players on each side compete on skycycles to carom free-floating inflatable balls, the size of volleyballs, colored and numbered 1 through 15. Six &#x201c;pockets&#x201d; are located at points on a virtual sphere: East, West, North, South, Up, and Down. The playing sphere is one hundred yards in diameter. Players strike any ball with a fist and must carom that ball off a target ball to score points into a pocket. All games are night games, as the playing fields must be located very near the internal sun, where spin gravity is near zero. As a proper playing field requires quite a large area of open space in near zero gee, there is no record of the game&#x2019;s being played anywhere but in large, hollow asteroids.</p><p>There I was, on my back, the broken part of the wing fluttering in my face. The ointment we rub onto them before a game to make them supple also makes them shimmer in rainbow colors like oil on water.</p><p>BLINKLINK: SKYCYCLE: A human-powered flying machine. Skycycles are extremely light, made of composite materials like buckytubes and monofilm. A high-end cycle will weigh no more than four or five pounds. They collapse to become no larger than an umbrella.</p><p>Human-powered flight is barely possible in a one-gee field, as on Old Earth, and easier in lower gravity, such as Old Mars. Much greater agility and endurance is possible in near zero gee.</p><p>A skycycle rider stretches out in the prone position and uses her legs to power an aft-mounted prop with up to twelve gear settings. Directional control is obtained by altering the shape and attitude of two sets of wings, two near the handlebars and two located near the waist of the rider.</p><p>Skypool players must use caution to remain in the low-gravity areas of the interior playing space, as dipping lower in the atmosphere can result in uncontrollable speed and lack of directional control.</p><p>An emergency parachute is worn while skycycling.</p><p>I pulled my left-center wing in a bit, then the right, and turned the left-front one to twist myself around. I got to where I was facedown&#x2014;the nearest ground was under me, and the sun was at my back&#x2014;and shifted gears to get more power from the propeller blade behind me. I knew I&#x2019;d lose some lift, so I hoped to gain some speed in a power dive before pulling out and swooping back into the game.</p><p>In no time I was heading out of the playing field in a down attitude, that is, aiming for the interior surface of the ship. That didn&#x2019;t alarm me; during a game you can be facing any direction at all, and you have to stray quite a distance from the arena before the air gives you enough spin to make increasing &#x201c;gravity&#x201d; a problem.</p><p>What I didn&#x2019;t like much was that it got a lot darker as I passed pretty close to one of the stadium lights, then behind it.</p><p>The lights are station-keepers, like the pocket rings. There are twenty of them, at the points of a twenty-sided polygon, an icosahedron, all oriented so that they point to the center of the playing field. When you move out of the field, it gets dark quickly.</p><p>But I wasn&#x2019;t worried. I&#x2019;d played a game with a damaged wing before. You just have to adjust your angle of attack. I was a lot more worried about getting back into the game.</p><p>This was the semifinal of the girls senior tournament between us, the Bayouville Gators, in black-and-gold tights, and the Hilltown Hillbillies, in crimson and mustard. The winner would go on to play the winner of the other semi, happening at the same time just a little north of us. It had been a hard-fought game. There were still four balls in the playing field. We were behind, but it could still go either way, depending on strategy in setting up high-value caroms. We couldn&#x2019;t afford even one mistake.</p><p>Maybe I pulled up a little too hard in my eagerness to get back into play, but I didn&#x2019;t realize how much damage that bitch Cheryl had caused.</p><p>Next thing I knew my arm was beating uselessly at the air while the damaged wing was twisting me like a corkscrew. I was powering down like a grouse hit by a shotgun blast.</p><p>I shifted gears into reverse, a gear you almost never use in flight. I mean, hummingbirds can do it, but when&#x2019;s the last time you saw an eagle flying backwards? I weigh a lot more than an eagle. I pedaled for all I was worth, hoping to slow down enough that I could assess the situation and not have to pop the chute. Popping the chute is a rookie move, a desperate move. It will get you ridiculed mercilessly for months to come, maybe forever. I felt the air start to blow, hard, over my back as the prop behind me began to churn the air.</p><p>Next step in the disaster: The remnants of my broken wing got caught in the draft and blew over me. Suddenly, I was blind, couldn&#x2019;t see a thing. I stopped pedaling and tried to remove the wing from in front of my face.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t happening. Some of the support wires had got tangled in the harness behind me. No matter how hard I tugged, they wouldn&#x2019;t come free.</p><p>I knew that getting back in the game was now impossible. It was going to be all I could do to land safely.</p><p>But I didn&#x2019;t really start to worry about that until the mainframe popped.</p><p>A flycycle is always going to be a compromise between sturdiness and lightness. The best ones look more like a sketch for a machine than the machine itself. Deployed, the wings are up to fifteen feet long, depending on the rider, and the frame is seven feet long.</p><p>The struts that make up the frame and the &#x201c;bones&#x201d; of the wings and prop are made of three nested nanotubes, no thicker than a pencil lead and hollow inside. These things are very, very strong for their weight, but they don&#x2019;t have a lot of give in them. Human muscles, and in particular the strong muscles of the legs, can strain them badly. Under enough stress, they will fracture.</p><p>That&#x2019;s what happened to me. It was like snapping your spine. The aft was no longer connected to the front. My feet were still strapped to the pedals, but pushing on them no longer turned the prop, it just shoved it farther away from me.</p><p>I arched my back, still trying to get the wing out of my eyes, and the severed end of the frame jabbed me in the butt.</p><p>And stayed there. It was in about four inches in the fatty layer and the gluteus, almost hitting my tailbone.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, <i>fiddlesticks</i>!&#x201d; I shouted. It hurt like heck, like sitting on a long spike.</p><p>I reached around and grabbed it, tried to pull it out. But there is a problem with nanotubes. Once their molecular structure is disrupted in one place, they start to come apart. This one snapped in my hand, leaving a big piece of it still inside me.</p><p>In a few moments, the whole structure of the flycycle was disintegrating all around me. It was like being wrapped up in a dozen clotheslines hung with laundry.</p><p>I finally managed to swat the wings away from my face, and I didn&#x2019;t like what I saw. I was moving down at a considerable speed now. The wind was coming from one side as the ship&#x2019;s spinning atmosphere began to accelerate me even more. The ground was coming up rapidly. It was definitely time to pop the chute, humiliation or not. So I reached over my shoulder to pull the ripcord.</p><p>Which was gone.</p><p>Finally, I began to really worry.</p><p>Cassie:</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure what alerted me to the fact that my sister was in trouble.</p><p>I was all the way across the field, lining up a shot that would have brought us to within a couple of points of the hated Hillbillies, when I must have seen something out of the corner of my eye. A smear of ketchup-and-mustard uniform uglying up the dark sky. A <i>big</i> smear, big enough that it almost had to be Cheryl Chang, coming out of a tight turn and heading back toward the center of the playing sphere. Too far away to see the expression on her face very well, but something about the easy way she was pedaling&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, I just didn&#x2019;t like it.</p><p>All this in my peripheral vision, you understand, but to be a good skypool player you have to develop the ability to see in pretty much all 180 degrees of your visual field.

We are mirror-image twins, she&#x2019;s left-handed and I&#x2019;m right-handed. We are hard to tell apart. But I claim no mystical connection with her.

The Broussards had the interior hollowed out by compression-bubble (also known as &#x201c;squeezer bubble&#x201d;) technology. Topsoil and plants were imported, an ecology was established.</p><p>The asteroid was an irregular &#x201c;potato-shaped&#x201d; carbonaceous chondrite with nickel-iron and water ice mixed in. Its exterior dimensions are eight miles by approximately four and a half miles. The interior of the ship is a cylinder six miles long and two miles in diameter. It has an interior surface of fifty square miles, but some of that is in the spherically curved ends, where the spin gravity decreases with distance from the interior surface. The flat surface is thirty-seven and a half square miles. This is around thirty-two thousand acres, though some of them are vertical. Its interior volume is almost nineteen cubic miles. The atmosphere inside is Earth-normal. The interior is divided into fifteen townships.</p><p>The ship has a population of twenty thousand, with an additional large number of colonists suspended in time stasis (also known as &#x201c;black bubbles.&#x201d;)</p><p>The asteroid was accelerated to a speed of .609 revolutions per minute, or 98.54 seconds per revolution. This produces a spin gravity of two-thirds gee on the interior surface, trailing off to zero gee at the axis of rotation.</p><p>The interior is illuminated by a long, cylindrical tube, fifty feet in diameter and over six miles long, which uses compression-bubble technology to produce light and heat.</p><p>Just in case, I corkscrewed around in the air, picking out every Gator.

A businessman and a rancher, Boone had it all&#x2014;except for Keely Welsh. The first time he spotted her on his property, he was determined not to let her get away from him. The lovely beauty would be his....<br><br>Every Long, Tall Texan gets his woman, and this one would not be denied.<br><br></p><p>The prolific author of more than one hundred books, Diana Palmer got her start as a newspaper reporter. A New York Times bestselling author and voted one of the top ten romance writers in America, she has a gift for telling the most sensual tales with charm and humor. Diana lives with her family in Cornelia, Georgia.Keely Welsh felt his presence before she looked up and saw him. It had been that way from the day she met Boone Sinclair, her best friend's eldest brother. The man wasn't movie-star handsome or gregarious. He was a recluse, a loner who hardly ever smiled, who intimidated people simply by walking into a room. For some unknown reason, Keely always knew when he was around, even if she didn't see him. <br><br>He was tall and slender, but he had powerful legs and big hands and feet. There were rumors about him that grew more exaggerated with the telling. He'd been in Special Forces overseas five years earlier. He'd saved his unit from certain destruction. He'd won medals. He'd had lunch with the president at the White House. He'd taken a cruise with a world-famous author. He'd almost married a European princess. And on and on and on. <br><br>Nobody knew the truth. Well, maybe Winona and Clark Sinclair did. Winnie and Clark and Boone were closer than brothers and sisters usually were. But Winnie didn't talk about her brother's private life, not even to Keely. <br><br>There hadn't been a day since she was thirteen when Keely hadn't loved Boone Sinclair. She watched him from a distance, her green eyes soft and covetous. Her hands would shake when she happened on him unexpectedly. They were shaking now. He was standing at the counter, signing in. He had an appointment for his dog's routine shots. He made one every year. He loved the old tan-and-black German shepherd, whose name was Bailey. People said it was the only thing on earth that he did love. Maybe he was fond of his siblings, but it didn't show. His affection for Bailey did. <br><br>One of the other vet techs came out with a pad and called in Bailey, with a grin at Boone. It wasn't returned. He led the old dog into one of the examination rooms. He walked right past Keely. He never looked at her. He didn't speak to her. As far as he was concerned, she was invisible. <br><br>She sighed as the door closed behind him and his dog. It was that way anyplace in town that he saw her. In fact, it was like that at his huge ranch near Comanche Wells, west of Jacobsville, Texas. He never told Winnie that she couldn't have Keely over for lunch or an occasional horseback ride. But he ignored her, just the same. <br><br>"It's funny, you know," Winnie had remarked one day when they were out riding. "I mean, Boone never makes any comment about you, but he does make a point of pretending he doesn't see you. I wonder why." She looked at Keely then, with her dark eyes mischievous in their frame of blond hair. "You wouldn't know, I guess?" <br><br>Keely only smiled. "I haven't got a clue," she said. It was the truth. <br><br>"It's only you, too," her friend continued thoughtfully. "He's very polite to our brother Clark's occasional date&#x2014;even to that waitress that Clark brought home one night for dinner, and you know what a snob Boone can be. But he pretends you don't exist." <br><br>"I may remind him of somebody he doesn't like," Keely replied. <br><br>"There was that girl he was engaged to," Winnie said out of the blue. <br><br>Keely's heart jumped. "Yes, I remember when he was engaged," she replied. It had been when she was fourteen, almost fifteen years old, just before he came back from overseas. Keely's young heart had been broken. <br><br>"It was just before you came back here to live with your mom," Winnie continued as if she'd read Keely's mind. "In fact, it was just about the time she started drinking so much more..." She hesitated. Keely's mother was an alcoholic and it was a sensitive subject to her friend. "Anyway, Boone was mustering out of the Army at the time. His fianc�e rushed to Germany where he'd been taken when he was airlifted out of combat, wounded, and then...poof. She was gone, Boone came home, and he never mentioned her name again. None of us could find out what happened." <br><br>"Somebody said she was European royalty," Keely ventured shyly. <br><br>"She was distantly related to some man who was knighted in England," came the sarcastic reply. "Anyway, she ran out on Boone and he was bitter for a long time. So three weeks ago the phone rings and he gets a call from her. She's been living with her father, who owns a private detective agency in SanAntonio. She told Boone she'd made a terrible mistake and wanted to make up." <br><br>Keely's heart fell. A rival who had a history with Boone. It made her miserable just to think about it, despite the fact that she would never get close enough to Boone to give the other woman any competition. "Boone doesn't forgive people," she said, thinking aloud. <br><br>"That's right," Winnie replied, smiling. "But he's mellowed a bit. He takes her out on dates occasionally now. In fact, they're going to a Desperado concert next week." <br><br>Keely frowned. "He likes hard rock?" she asked, surprised. He looked so staid and dignified that she couldn't picture him at a rock concert. She said so. <br><br>Winnie laughed. "I can," she said. "He's not the conservative, quiet man he seems to be. Especially when he loses his temper or gets in an argument." <br><br>"Boone doesn't argue," Keely mused aloud. <br><br>He didn't. If he was angry enough, he punched. Never women, of course, but his men knew not to push him, especially if he was broody. One horse handler had found out the hard way that nobody made jokes at the boss's expense. Boone had been kicked by a horse, which the handler thought was hilarious. Boone roped the man, tied him to a post and anointed him with a bucket of recycled hay. All without saying a word. <br><br>Keely laughed out loud. <br><br>"What?" Winnie asked. <br><br>"I was remembering that horse wrangler...." <br><br>Winnie laughed, too. "He couldn't believe it, he said, even when it was happening. Boone really does look so straitlaced, as if he'd never stoop to dirty his hands. His cowboys used to underestimate him. Not anymore." <br><br>"The rattlesnake episode is noteworthy, as well," came the amused reply. <br><br>"That cook was so shocked!" Winnie blurted out. "He was a really rotten cook, but he threatened to sue Boone if he fired him, so it looked as if we were stuck with him. He'd threatened to cook Boone a rattler if he made any more remarks about the food. He added a few spicy comments about why Boone's fianc�e took a powder. Then one morning he looks in his Dutch oven to see if it's clean enough to cook in, and a rattlesnake jumps up right into his face!" <br><br>"Lucky for the cook it didn't have any fangs." <br><br>"The cook didn't know that!" Winnie laughed. "He didn't know who did it, either. He resigned on the spot. The men actually cheered as he drove off. The next cook was talented, and the soul of politeness to my brother." <br><br>"I am not surprised." <br><br>She shook her head. "Boone does have these little quirks," his sister murmured. "Like never turning on the heat in his bedroom, even in icy weather, and always going around with his shirts buttoned to the neck." <br><br>"I've never seen him with his shirt off," Keely remarked. It was unusual, because most of the cowboys worked topless in summer heat when they were branding or doctoring cattle. But Boone never did. <br><br>"He used to be less prudish," Winnie said. <br><br>"Boone, prudish?" Keely sounded shocked. <br><br>Winnie glanced at her and chuckled. "Well, I guess that really doesn't fit at all." <br><br>"No, it doesn't." <br><br>Winnie pursed her lips. "Come to think of it, he's not the only prude around here. I've never even seen you in a T-shirt, Keely. You always wear long sleeves and high necklines." <br><br>Keely had a good reason for that, one she'd never shared with anyone. It was the reason she didn't date. It was a terrible secret. She would have died rather than tell Winnie, who might tell Boone.... <br><br>"I was raised very strictly," Keely said quietly. And she had been; for all their odd tendencies, both her parents had insisted that Keely go to Sunday School and church every single Sunday. "My father didn't approve of clothing that was too flashy or revealing." <br><br>Probably because Keely's mother propositioned any man she fancied when she drank. She'd even tried to seduce Boone. Keely didn't know that, and Winnie didn't know how to tell her. It was one reason for Boone's antagonism toward Keely. <br><br>Things would have been better if Keely knew where her father was. She'd told people she thought he was dead, because it was easier than admitting that he was an alcoholic, just like her mother, and linked up with a bunch of dangerous men. She'd missed her father at first. But she'd have been in more danger if she'd stayed with him. <br><br>She still loved him, in her way, despite what had happened to her. <br><br>"Come to think of it, Keely, you don't even date." <br><br>Keely shrugged. "I'm a vet tech. I have a busy life. I work on call, you know. If there's an emergency at midnight on a weekend, I still go to the office." <br><br>"That's a lot of hogwash," Winnie said gently as they paused to let the horses drink from one of the crystal-clear streams on the wooded property where they were riding. "I've even tried to set you up with nice men I know from work. You freeze when a man comes near you." <br><br>"That's because you work with the police, Winnie, and you bring cops home as prospective dates for me," Keely said mischievously. It was true. Winnie worked as a clerk in the Jacobsville Police Department's office during the day, and now she was doing a stint two nights a week as a dispatcher for the 911 center. In fact, she was hoping that job would work into something permanent, because being around Officer Kilraven all day when he was on the day shift was killing her. <br><br>"Policemen make me nervous," Keely was saying. "For all you know, I might have a criminal past." <br><br>Winnie wasn't smiling. She shook her head. "You're hiding something." <br><br>"Nothing major. Honest." What she suspected about her father, if true, would have shamed her. If Boone ever found out, she'd really die of shame. But she hadn't heard from her father since she was thirteen, so it wasn't likely that he'd just turn up someday with his new outlaw friends. She prayed that he wouldn't. Her mother's behavior was hard enough to live down as it was. <br><br>"There's this really handsome policeman who's been working with us for a few weeks. He's just your type." <br><br>"Kilraven," Keely guessed. <br><br>"Yes! How did you know?" <br><br>"Because you talk about him all the time," Keely returned. She pursed her lips. "Are you sure you aren't interested in him? I mean, you're single and eligible yourself." <br><br>Winnie flushed. "He's not my type." <br><br>"Why not?" <br><br>Winnie shifted in the saddle uneasily. "He told me he wasn't my type. He said I was too young to be mooning over a used-up lobo wolf like him and not to do it anymore." <br><br>Keely gasped out loud. "He didn't!" <br><br>The older girl nodded sadly. "He did. I didn't realize that I was so obvious with it. I mean, he's drop-dead gorgeous, most women look at him. He just noticed more when I did it. Because I'm who I am, I guess," she added darkly. "Boone might have said something to him. He's very protective of me. He thinks I'm too naive to be let loose on the world." <br><br>"In his defense, you have led a sheltered life," Keely said gently. "Kilraven is street smart. And he's dangerous." <br><br>"I know," Winnie muttered. "There have been times that he's been in situations where I sweat blood until he walks back into the station. He's noticed that, too. He didn't like it and he said so." She took a long, sad breath and looked at Keely. "So you can know all about my private agony, but you won't share yours? It's no use, Keely. I know." <br><br>Keely laughed nervously. "Know what? I don't keep secrets." <br><br>"Your whole life is a secret. But your biggest one is that you're in love with my brother." <br><br>Keely looked as if she'd been slapped. <br><br>"I would never tell him," Winnie said quietly. "That's the truth. I'm sorry for the way he treats you. I know how much it hurts." <br><br>Keely shifted her eyes, embarrassed. <br><br>"Don't be like that," Winnie said, her voice gentle. "I won't tell. Ever. Honest." <br><br>Keely relaxed. She drew in a breath, watching the creek bubble over rocks. "It doesn't hurt anything, what I feel. He'll never know. And it helps me to understand what it might be like to love a man&#x2014;even if that love is never returned. It's a taste of something I can never have, that's all." <br><br>Winnie frowned. "What do you mean? Of course you'll be loved one day! Keely, you're only nineteen. Your whole life is ahead of you!" <br><br>Keely looked at her friend, and her dark eyes were soft and sad. "Not that way, it isn't. I won't ever marry." <br><br>"But one day..." <br><br>She shook her head. "No." <br><br>Winnie bit her lower lip. "When you're a little older, it might be different," she began. "Keely, you're nineteen. Boone is thirty. That's a big age difference, and he thinks about things like that. His fianc�e was only a year younger than he was. He said that people should never marry unless they're the same age." <br><br>"Why?" <br><br>Winnie sighed. "I've never talked about it much, but our mother was twelve years younger than dad. He died a broken man because she ran away with his younger brother. He always said he made a major mistake by marrying someone from another generation. It was just too many years between them. They had nothing in common." <br><br>Keely felt heartsick for the family. "Is your mother still alive?" <br><br>She bit her lip. "We...don't know," she said. "We've never tried to find her or our uncle. They married, after the divorce, and moved to Montana. Neither one of them ever tried to contact us again." <br><br>"That's so sad." <br><br>"It made Boone bitter. Well, that and then his fianc�e cutting out on him. He doesn't have a high opinion of women." <br><br>"You can't blame him, really," Keely had to admit. She patted her horse's neck. "It's sad, isn't it, that we're both too young for the men we care about?" <br><br>"Only in their minds," Winnie returned. "But we can always change their opinions. We just have to find an angle. One that works." <br><br>Keely laughed. "Doesn't that sound easy?" <br><br>Winnie grimaced. "Not really." She tugged on the reins, backing her horse out of the creek. Keely followed suit.</p><h2>Looking for Home (The Orphan&#39;s Journey, Book 1)</h2><p>In 1907, while starting a new life in a Christian orphanage, eight-year-old Ethan and his three younger siblings hear about the prospect of being sent west on an Orphan Train and pray to stay together.</p><p>A teacher and librarian, Arleta Richardson was a beloved children&#x2019;s author.

New problems have been added throughout.</p><p>Some praise for the previous edition: &nbsp; JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA Review by Uwe J. Hansen, Indiana State University "While coming to us as a survey, [the book] nevertheless prepares us with a thorough and mathematically rigorous theoretical basis before embarking on the journey through the acoustical archipelago ... In such an all-encompassing text, the depth of several individual topics covered at an introductory graduate level is truly astounding. ... In summary, this is a remarkable text at the advanced undergraduate or introductory graduate level. Its strength lies in its breadth of coverage, in its level of sophistication, and in its didactic value. Many concepts introduced in the chapters are illustrated by applied example problems with solutions. Additional problems at the end of each chapter are carefully chosen to provide practical computational exercises while demanding conceptual understanding. References include relevant texts, summary monographs, and current journal articles. The structure of the second half of the book as relatively independent chapters lends itself nicely to course construction. Chapters with less relevance to a particular field can easily be omitted and others can readily be enhanced with the use of the reference section at the end of each chapter." JOURNAL OF THE AUDIO ENGINEERING SOCIETY Review by Neil A. Shaw "... Very comprehensive and adept ... Daniel R. Raichel [...] has produced what is the next step in the natural evolution of a general introductory acoustics text. His presentation of the material is very effective, especially in the way the concepts in one chapter segue into the next. The presentation throughout the book is very clear and straightforward with case studies and examples that are quite lucid. The Science and Applications of Acoustics is recommended for all who want a good introductory text to the subject. Many practitioners will also benefit from some of the more esoteric material." &nbsp; THE PHYSICIST Review by Neville Fletcher, Australian National University "Acoustics is a wide-ranging subject, and this book attempts the ambitious task of giving an account, not just of the basic theory, but also of most of its major applications. The target readership is at advanced undergraduate or early graduate level, and the pedagogical aim is reinforced by inclusion of an occasional worked example and a dozen or so problems at the end of each chapter. The problems are, however, not intrusive, and the book can also be regarded as a useful information source. ... For anyone who wants a broad and up-to-date introduction to the many applied aspects of acoustics, I can recommend this book. It would also be a good text for a graduate-level survey course."This textbook treats the broad range of modern acoustics from the basics of wave propagation in solids and fluids to applications such as noise control and cancellation, underwater acoustics, music and music synthesis, sonoluminescence, and medical diagnostics with ultrasound.The discussion begins with a historical overview. It then turns to a derivation of the wave equation from the fundamental equations of motion for fluids and for solids, with solutions of the equation in open air and in bounded media such as strings, bars, membranes, and pipes. Sound filters and electric analogs for sound propagation are also treated. A chapter on measurement techniques provides a comprehensive survey of the means of evaluating sound levels and frequency content of signals. A section of the physiology of hearing and psychoacoustics includes recent findings on how the human ear functions. The remainder of the book deals with a wide variety of applications including architectural acoustics; enclosures and barriers; noise codes and regulations;, and methods of noise control; underwater acoustics; ultrasound; vibration control; and music, musical instruments, and reproduction of music.<p></p>The new edition is up-to-date and forward-looking in approach. Chapter 2 now covers fluid-fluid interface effects, with additional information on newest measurement techniques. Updates are provided on the use of ultrasound in industry, and deeper coverage is provided on medical uses of ultrasound. The chapter on music and musical instruments has been broken up into two chapters, one chapter covering music and musical instruments and the other covering sound reproduction and including the latest devices such MP3; iPod; 5.1-, 6.1-, and 7.1-channel systems; and THX and Iosono theater systems. Additional coverage of the opto-acoustics and sonoluminescence phenomena is included. New problems have been added throughout.</p><h2>Is There a Meaning in This Text?</h2><p>Is there a meaning in the Bible, or is meaning rather a matter of who is reading or of how one reads? Does Christian doctrine have anything to contribute to debates about interpretation, literary theory, and postmodernity? These are questions of crucial importance for contemporary biblical studies and theology alike. Kevin Vanhoozer contends that the postmodern crisis in hermeneutics--&#39;&#39;incredulity towards meaning,&#39; a deep-set skepticism concerning the possibility of correct interpretation--is fundamentally a crisis in theology provoked by an inadequate view of God and by the announcement of God&#39;s &#39;death.&#39; Part 1 examines the ways in which deconstruction and radical reader-response criticism &#39;undo&#39; the traditional concepts of author, text, and reading. Dr. Vanhoozer engages critically with the work of Derrida, Rorty, and Fish, among others, and demonstrates the detrimental influence of the postmodern &#39;suspicion of hermeneutics&#39; on biblical studies. In Part 2, Dr. Vanhoozer defends the concept of the author and the possibility of literary knowledge by drawing on the resources of Christian doctrine and by viewing meaning in terms of communicative action. He argues that there is a meaning in the text, that it can be known with relative adequacy, and that readers have a responsibility to do so by cultivating &#39;interpretive virtues.&#39; Successive chapters build on Trinitarian theology and speech act philosophy in order to treat the metaphysics, methodology, and morals of interpretation. From a Christian perspective, meaning and interpretation are ultimately grounded in God&#39;s own communicative action in creation, in the canon, and preeminently in Christ. Prominent features in Part 2 include a new account of the author&#39;s intention and of the literal sense, the reclaiming of the distinction between meaning and significance in terms of Word and Spirit, and the image of the reader as a disciple-martyr, whose vocation is to witness to something other than oneself. Is There a Meaning in This Text? guides the student toward greater confidence in the authority, clarity, and relevance of Scripture, and a well-reasoned expectation to understand accurately the message of the Bible. Is There a Meaning in This Text? is a comprehensive and creative analysis of current debates over biblical hermeneutics that draws on interdisciplinary resources, all coordinated by Christian theology. It makes a significant contribution to biblical interpretation that will be of interest to readers in a number of fields. The intention of the book is to revitalize and enlarge the concept of author-oriented interpretation and to restore confidence that readers of the Bible can reach understanding. The result is a major challenge to the central assumptions of postmodern biblical scholarship and a constructive alternative proposal--an Augustinian hermeneutic--that reinvigorates the notion of biblical authority and finds a new exegetical practice that recognizes the importance of both the reader&#39;s situation and the literal sense.</p><p>This monograph on hermeneutics is part of Foundations of Contemporary Interpretation (which has been reissued in one volume). A brilliant young evangelical scholar, Kevin Vanhoozer begins by giving the philosophical background to the history of the hermeneutical task. He then discusses modern approaches to hermeneutics, particularly those that insist that no meaning can be ascribed to a text. He goes on to build a strong case for a hermeneutic that insists that literary texts--particularly the Bible--do in fact convey a meaning that can be derived from he text. This book can rightly be called a theology of interpretation.Kevin Vanhoozer (Ph.D., Cambridge University) is senior lecturer in theology and religious studies at New College, University of Edinburgh, in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Other features include a chronology of cases, an index of cases by parties and by popular titles, a subject index, a glossary of legal terms, and guidance on how to read a legal citation.</p><p>Roy M. Mersky is the Harry M. Reasoner Regents Chair in Law, director of legal research, and law library at the Tarlton Law Library at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin.Although other works, such as <i>The Oxford Guide to U.S. Supreme Court Decisions</i> (Oxford, 1999), <i>Encyclopedia of the U.S. Supreme Court</i> (Salem, 2000), and <i>Supreme Court Compendium: Data, Decisions, and Developments</i> (CQ Press, 2003), provide information on landmark cases, this one succinctly describes the backgrounds of more than 350 "most important" cases and offers insight into their significance and effects on American life. The authors give no criteria for selecting these particular cases, but all seem significant in their impact. <p>The cases are arranged alphabetically under 15 subject categories such as "Abortion," "Freedom of Religion," "Jurisdiction," and one catch-all category, "Additional Cases." The latter includes cases that addressed the death penalty, eminent domain, blue laws, and trials of captured enemies by military tribunal, to name a few. Each entry features the case title, legal citation, year of decision, key issues, history, summary of the arguments, aftermath, significance, and related cases. Most entries are no more than two pages long. There is a detailed index that enables users to find specific cases or topics. A 13-page glossary includes the expected legal terms and a few technological terms, such as <i>CD-ROM, database</i>, and <i>microfiche</i>. Recommended readings at the end of each entry, a list of sources by case, and a brief bibliography direct the reader to other works.</p><p>This source should be useful to anyone wanting to study the development and impact of the U.S. Supreme Court and to anyone who wants to understand the significance of those few cases (approximately 150 of the 7,000 filed each year) that make it through the selection process and are heard there. Readers can grasp the Court's evolving power by using the chronologically arranged table (although it oddly skips from 1989 to 2003 even though this work includes some cases from the intervening years). They can also see attitudinal changes in the Court by studying the various cases under each subject heading.

These lively and provocative lectures function as a gloss to Spicer's own poetry, a general discourse on poetics, and a cautionary handbook for young poets.

Emerging from their late model cars, they tucked under umbrellas and made their way through the raw spring air toward the carillon bells ringing from the tower. Inside the sanctuary, organ music soared from the south wall of the nave, drawing the eye upward to the intricately carved wood, stone, and brilliant stained glass. As the mourners were ushered into pews, they nodded solemnly to one another; most everyone knew each other. They were gathered to acknowledge the passing of and pay tribute to the remarkable life of a seventy-four-year-old woman who had died three days before. Her name was Elizabeth Hughes Gossett.<br>Although most of the mourners would likely claim to have known Elizabeth well, only a few people in the church knew just how remarkable her life really was. Dr. Lowell Eklund, dean of continuing education at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, rose to the pulpit to deliver the eulogy. He mentioned Elizabeth&#x2019;s &#x201c;intellect, wisdom, quiet yet irresistible leadership.&#x201d; He mentioned her distinguished service as a trustee of her alma mater, Barnard College, in New York City. He said that she, like her father, America&#x2019;s most famous lawyer, jurist, and politician, had been a lifelong advocate of self-directed scholarship and perpetual inquiry. It was this spirit, he said, that had led her to play an important role in the founding of Oakland University in 1957.<br>Did Eklund know that the circumstances of her early life had forced her to pursue her education as a self-directed and largely solitary endeavor? If he knew, he didn&#x2019;t say.<br>As heiress to the legacy of a great American statesman, she carried forth her father&#x2019;s ideals with &#x201c;modesty, dignity and grace,&#x201d; he said. Dr. Eklund described her as &#x201c;a champion of civil rights in speech, in document and in action.&#x201d; He went on to say that she had cofounded, with her friend Chief Justice Warren Burger, the Supreme Court Historical Society in 1974. But did Eklund know why this daughter was especially compelled to protect her father&#x2019;s legacy, of how the great man had risked everything for her sake?<br>Sitting in the front pew with his smooth, clean hands folded in his lap was William T. Gossett, to whom Elizabeth had been married for fifty years, a former member of the church vestry. Around him were seated their three children, Antoinette, William, and Elizabeth, and next to them were their spouses, Basil, Mary, and Fred, respectively. Also seated in front were the eight grandchildren, the eldest of whom was David Wemyss Denning, son of Antoinette and Basil. In 1981 he was a twenty-four-year-old medical student. Dappled light, steeped in the rich jewel tones of the towering east window, played over the heads of the family like the lightest touch from an invisible hand.<br>David knew that Eklund would not mention what to his mind was one of the most important and remarkable facts of his grandmother&#x2019;s life. This fact had also been omitted from his grandmother&#x2019;s obituaries in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, and the leading Michigan papers. In 1922, Elizabeth Hughes was among the first children to receive an experimental pancreatic extract called insulin. By the time of her death, she had received some 42,000 insulin injections over fifty-eight years, probably more than anyone on earth at that time. And yet, through Elizabeth Gossett&#x2019;s own steadfast efforts only a few people knew this, and those few were sworn to secrecy.<br>How ironic to hear Eklund describe Elizabeth as a lover of history; it was a perfect alibi for someone who had made a lifework of obfuscating her own history. This effort had been so successful that Dr. Eklund had no knowledge of the brave, bright spirit whose childhood had been tempered in the crucible of death&#x2019;s daily and intimate companionship.<br>The last will and testament of Elizabeth Hughes Gossett arranged for the disposition of her jewelry, personal effects, and works of art. After the will was executed, there remained in her estate an odd collection of cryptic relics, like a muddle of jigsaw puzzle pieces from different puzzles:<br>&nbsp;<br>Thirty or so letters tied with a satin ribbon. The letters had been written by Elizabeth during 1921 and 1922, mostly to her mother (&#x201c;Mumsey&#x201d;), when Elizabeth was fourteen and fifteen years old. The letters had been written from New York State, Bermuda, and Toronto, marking points on her peripatetic attempt to evade the death that pursued her relentlessly.<br>A small, hand-knitted sweater of fine, faded blue wool, which looked to be made for a child eight or nine years old.<br>An old photograph of a modest house in Glens Falls, New York, showing a rocking chair on the front porch. On the back of the image were the words, Save one life and save the world, written in indigo ink in an elegant hand.<br>A square of canvas removed from its frame, bearing a rough oil painting of a farm house rendered in pigments of burnt umber and cobalt.<br>A small brown glass medicinal vial with an age-yellowed label on which the words had faded to illegibility.<br>&nbsp;<br>These mute artifacts were all that remained of Elizabeth Hughes&#x2019;s life before her miraculous transformation into an entirely different girl. What follows is the improbable story of that Elizabeth&#x2014;the Elizabeth that Elizabeth erased. This is the story of Elizabeth Hughes, who &#x201c;vanished&#x201d; in December of 1922 without a memorial service or a funeral, without anyone ever really even noticing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Excerpted from Breakthrough by Thea Cooper and Arthur Ainsberg.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Thea Cooper and Arthur Ainsberg.<br>Published in September 2010 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press.<br>All rights reserved.

This book is a must read for anyone who suffers constant pain, or any reader who wants to be encouraged by the drive of the human spirit. Dr. Gipp shares his personal story of how his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and his devotion to daily Bible reading has helped him deal with the constant agony, and his journey through life Living with Pain!</p><p>Living with Pain is a great book for those who want to deal with their chronic pain without having it rule their life. Dr. Gipp confronts the subject with humor and compassion not from the side of a physician but from the side of one who has chronic pain everyday and is able to be an encouregment to others.Dr. Samuel Gipp has experienced his share of troublesome times. As a youth, his wayward life had him headed for a prison cell. But his conversion to Christ at the age of 20 changed the direction of his life dramatically. Then, three years later an accident resulted in a broken neck. That injury was incredibly ignored by doctors and he went on for almost three months before the problem was corrected. But the damage had been done and today he is remained of the day so long ago by the pain he experiences every day. The experiences in this book have helped him and many others keep going. He decided to share them with others in the hope that they might have the same encouraging effects on them. A highly-sought after evangelist, Dr. Gipp travels throughout the world speaking and encouraging thousands each year. Dr. Gipp has written over 17 books. He and his wife Kathy have been married for over 30 years.

It is a world where small businesses are becoming increasingly more sophisticated at digging up information about their competitors--and are using it to beat the big players at their own game. <p>Welcome to the era of Business Intelligence, where staying one move ahead of the competition requires uncovering their secrets and using them to your advantage. </p><p>In Confidential, John Nolan, a former federal intelligence officer and a preeminent expert in the field of Business Intelligence, reveals how your company can gather the intelligence it needs to beat the competition, while keeping your own valuable secrets under wraps. Providing the basics of Business Intelligence, including such invaluable techniques as data elicitation and sourcing as well as higher-level intelligence gathering and counterintelligence tactics for more sophisticated corporate policy makers, Confidential reveals: </p><p>How a well-planned conversation can be your most valuable information gathering tool </p><p>Who will most likely tell you what you want to know--and who is supposedly unsusceptible </p><p>How to discover the people who know what you need to know, both inside your company and outside, inside your industry, and beyond </p><p>How studying your customers and the leaders and decision-makers in their industries can enhance your competitive intelligence in significant ways </p><p>Why trade shows present an unparalleled opportunity for intelligence--what to look for, how to obtain it </p><p>Which countermeasures will ensure that neither you nor your employees become the unwitting sources of leaks </p><p>How to translate information into action that will directly affect your company's profits </p><p>Whether you're looking to find out the design and price of a competitor's upcoming product line, or uncover the dangers of entering a new market, this comprehensive, practical handbook offers effective strategies that anyone from senior-level executives to middle managers can utilize to protect themselves and outwit the competition.</p></p><p>People say the darnedest things. They tell you how much money they make, how well their company did in the last quarter, what it'll take to undercut their latest bid on a government project or to undermine their marketing efforts. All you have to do is ask. <p> John Nolan, a 22-year veteran of international espionage who is currently involved in corporate intelligence-gathering, shows you how to ask, what to ask, when to ask, and whom to ask. The methods can be as simple as deliberately making a misstatement--"The toothpaste division sure missed its projections this quarter"--and getting someone who knows better to correct you, in the process supplying you with the information you want about his company's inner workings. Or they can be as complicated as patiently and doggedly piecing together tiny scraps of information from a number of sources. Whichever you resort to, Nolan shows a conversational method for ensuring that the person dispensing the information doesn't even remember he or she gave it out.

How did the seed that became Alcoholics Anonymous take root and develop? The articles in this book tell much of that story. In the Grapevine, AA&#39;s international journal, co-founder Bill W. recorded--and reflected on--AA&#39;s history as it happened. A prolific writer, Bill authored more than 150 Grapevine articles, from 1944 to the late 1960&#39;s and virtually all of them appear here, published for the first time in one volume. A man of extraordinary energy and action, Bill committed his thoughts to paper with great facility. Yet the lessons of which he writes were born of a long and arduous process of trial and error, and in the events and insights he chronicled from AA&#39;s pioneer years, sober alcoholics can find their own struggles and those of their groups today. Covering a multitude of topics, from the basic principles of AA&#39;s Steps and Traditions to a discussion of the personal search of many AA members for &#39;emotional sobriety,&#39; Bill&#39;s words hold meaning for AA members of any age. Writing ten years after his first visit to European AA with his wife Lois in 1950, Bill had this to say: &#39;As we journeyed from land to land, we had the same magnificent adventure in kinship over and over...Everywhere, everywhere, it was the same . . . the communication of heart to heart in wonder, in joy, and in everlasting gratitude. Lois and I knew then that AA could circle the globe--and it has.&#39; It is the belief of the Grapevine editors that the fundamental AA experience expressed here will illuminate every facet of AA life--a way of life that has, over the years, helped one suffering alcoholic to communicate with another in &#39;the language of the heart.&#39;&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Chuck Smith Autobiography: A Memoir of Grace</h2><p>In times of trouble, trial, pain or loss, we often can t see the value in what we re experiencing.

Millions of Americans are on it. And just about everyone else is wondering if they should be on it, too. The claims of the pro-Prozac chorus are enticing: that it can cure everything from depression (the only disorder for which Prozac was originally approved) to fear of public speaking, PMS, obesity, shyness, migraine, and back pain - with few or no side effects. But is the reality quite different? At what price do we buy Prozac-induced euphoria and a shiny new personality?<br>Psychiatrist Peter Breggin, M.D., and coauthor Ginger Ross Breggin answer these and other crucial questions in Talking Back to Prozac. They explain what Prozac is and how it works. And they take a hard look at the real story behind today's most controversial drug: the fact that Prozac was tested in trials of four to six weeks in length before receiving FDA approval; the difficulty Prozac's manufacturer had in proving its effectiveness during these tests; the information on side effects that the FDA failed to include in its final labeling requirements; how Prozac acts as a stimulant not unlike the addictive drugs cocaine and amphetamine; the dangers of possible Prozac addiction and abuse; the seriousness and frequency of Prozac's side effects, including agitation, insomnia, nausea, diarrhea, loss of libido, and difficulty reaching orgasm; the growing evidence that Prozac can cause violence and suicide; and the social and workplace implications of using the drug not to cure depression but to change personality and enhance performance.<br>Using dramatic case histories as well as scientific research and carefully documented evidence, the Breggins expose the potentially damaging effects of Prozac. They also describe the resounding success that has been achieved with more humane alternatives for the treatment of depression. Talking Back to Prozac provides essential information for anyone who takes Prozac or is considering taking it, and for those who prescribe it.</p><p>Are you one of the thousands of Americans &#34;listening to Prozac&#34;? Chances are you at least know someone who is. It&#39;s time to take a closer look at this supposedly &#34;safe&#34; drug. Peter Breggin picks through the studies used to justify Prozac&#39;s safety, often uncovering flaws and shoddy science. He details the FDA approval process, including who on the panel was paid by whom. The key players and the details will surprise you.Peter R.

Its appeal lies in the broad scope of its teachings and in the depth and clarity of its prescriptions for contemplative practice. Its wealth of theoretical and practical instruction in the spiritual life often made it the first major text to be studied by newly ordained monks, particularly in the Chan School. The new translation, prepared by members of the Buddhist Text Translation Society, is enhanced by excerpts from the commentary by the Venerable Master Hsuan Hua (Xuanhua).</p><p>"A must for anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the Buddhist teaching." --Huston Smith, author of The Worlds Religions and Why Religion Matters<br><br>"When people ask about the Buddhas teachings on meditation, in addition to the core texts on the subject in the Pali Canon (the scriptures of the Southern School), I frequently cite the Surangama Sutra as being of inestimable value. It spells out certain aspects of the meditative process in uniquely clear and helpful ways... In particular I have employed the Sutra's teachings concerning the meditation on hearing as a central element of my spiritual training for more than twenty-five years... This lucid, accessible and reliable translation of the Surangama Sutra, with its commentarial notes by the highly esteemed Master Hsuan Hua, will be a distinctive and precious addition to the bookshelves of not only those interested in Buddhist philosophy as an academic discipline but, more importantly, to those who wish to liberate their own hearts and minds for the benefit of themselves and all other living beings." --Ajahn Amaro Bhikkhu, co-abbot of Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery<br><br>"The Buddhist Text Translation Society has given us a greatly improved rendering of one of the most important and profound Mahayana texts in the entire Buddhist Canon. During the past thousand years, the Surangama Sutra has been used perhaps more than any other single text in the transmission of the Dharma by Chinese and other East Asian masters. This eminently readable and clearly annotated English translation constitutes a significant contribution not only to the study but also to the practice of Buddhism in the West." --Bill Porter (Red Pine), translator of the works of Chinese poets and Buddhist masters, including The Collected Poems of Cold Mountain and The Zen Teachings of Bodhidharma</p><h2>I&#39;ll Walk Alone: A Novel</h2><p><b>Now in mass market, Mary Higgins Clark&#x2019;s thirtieth and most spine-chilling novel&#x2014;&#x201c;so good that it might as well have come with a soundtrack&#x201d; (<i>The Columbus Dispatch</i>)&#x2014;involves the newest and most up-to-date of crimes: identity theft. </b><br><br>Alexandra &#x201c;Zan&#x201d; Moreland, a gifted, beautiful interior designer on the verge of a successful Manhattan career, is terrified to discover that somebody is not only using her credit cards, but may also be impersonating her in a scheme that involves the much more brutal crimes of kidnapping and murder.

The seventy-eight-year-old Franciscan friar approved of the alternate way of administering the sacrament, that of having the penitent sit in the Reconciliation Room with him, rather than kneeling on the hard wood of the confessional with a screen hiding his or her identity.<br> <br>The one time he felt the new way did not work was when, sitting face-to-face, he sensed that the penitents might not be able to allow themselves to say what might have been confided in darkness.<br> <br>This was happening now on this chilly, windswept afternoon in March.<br> <br>In the first hour he had sat in the room, only two women had shown up, regular parishioners, both in their mideighties, whose sins, if any had ever existed, were long behind them. Today one of them had confessed that when she was eight years old she remembered telling a lie to her mother. She had eaten two cupcakes and blamed her brother for the missing one.<br> <br>As Fr. Aiden was praying his rosary until he was scheduled to leave the room, the door opened and a slender woman who looked to be in her early thirties came in. Her expression tentative, she moved slowly toward the chair facing him and hesitantly sat down on it. Her auburn hair was loose on her shoulders. Her fur-collared suit was clearly expensive, as were her high-heeled leather boots. Her only jewelry was silver earrings.<br> <br>His expression serene, Fr. Aiden waited. Then when the young woman did not speak, he asked encouragingly, &#x201c;How can I help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how to begin.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s voice was low and pleasant, with no hint of a geographical accent.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing you can tell me that I haven&#x2019;t already heard,&#x201d; Fr. Aiden said mildly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I . . .&#x201d; The woman paused, then the words came rushing out. &#x201c;I know about a murder that someone is planning to commit and I can&#x2019;t stop it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her expression horrified, she clasped her hand over her mouth and abruptly stood up. &#x201c;I should never have come here,&#x201d; she whispered. Then, her voice trembling with emotion, she said, &#x201c;Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I confess that I am an accessory to a crime that is ongoing and to a murder that is going to happen very soon. You&#x2019;ll probably read about it in the headlines. I don&#x2019;t want to be part of it, but it&#x2019;s too late to stop.&#x201d;<br> <br>She turned and in five steps had her hand on the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Fr. Aiden called, trying to struggle to his feet. &#x201c;Talk to me. I can help you.&#x201d;<br> <br>But she was gone.<br> <br>Was the woman psychotic? Fr. Aiden wondered. Could she possibly have meant what she said? And if so, what could he do about it?<br> <br>If she was telling the truth, I can do nothing about it, he thought, as he sank back into the chair. I don&#x2019;t know who she is or where she lives. I can only pray that she is irrational and that this scenario is some kind of fantasy. But if she is not irrational, she is shrewd enough to know that I am bound by the seal of the confessional. At some point she may have been a practicing Catholic. The words she used, &#x201c;Bless me, Father, for I have sinned,&#x201d; was the way a penitent used to begin to confess.<br> <br>For long minutes he sat alone. When the woman exited, the green light over the Reconciliation Room door had automatically gone on, which meant that anyone waiting outside would have been free to enter. He found himself praying fervently that the young woman might return, but she did not.<br> <br>He was supposed to leave the room at six o&#x2019;clock. But it was twenty minutes after six when he gave up hope that she might come back. Finally, aware of the weight of his years and the spiritual burden of his role as confessor, Fr. Aiden placed both hands on the arms of his chair and got up slowly, wincing at the sharp thrust of pain in his arthritic knees. Shaking his head, he began to walk to the door but stopped for a moment in front of the chair where the young woman had been sitting.<br> <br>She wasn&#x2019;t crazy, he thought sadly. I can only pray that if she really has knowledge that the crime of a murder is about to be committed, she does what her conscience is telling her to do. She must prevent it.<br> <br>He opened the door and saw two people lighting candles in front of the statue of St. Jude in the atrium of the church. A man was kneeling on the prie-dieu in front of the Shrine of St. Anthony, his face buried in his hands. Fr. Aiden hesitated, wondering if he should ask the visitor if he wanted to go to confession. Then he reflected that the posted hours for hearing confessions had been over for nearly half an hour. Maybe this visitor was begging for a favor or giving thanks for receiving one. The Shrine of St. Anthony was a favorite stop for many of their visitors.<br> <br>Fr. Aiden walked across the atrium to the door that led to the passage to the Friary. He did not feel the intense gaze of the man who was no longer deep in prayer but had turned, pushed up his dark glasses, and was studying him intently, taking note of his rim of white hair and slow gait.<br> <br>She was only in there less than a minute, the observer thought. How much did she tell that old priest? he wondered. Can I afford to take the chance that she didn&#x2019;t spill her guts to him? The man could hear the outer doors of the church being opened and the sound of approaching steps. Quickly he replaced his sunglasses and pulled up the collar of his trench coat. He had already copied Fr. Aiden&#x2019;s name from the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do I do about you, Fr. O&#x2019;Brien?&#x201d; he asked himself angrily, as he brushed past the dozen or so visitors entering the church.<br> <br>For the moment he had no answer.<br> <br>What he did not realize was that he, the observer, was being observed. Sixty-six-year-old Alvirah Meehan, the cleaning woman turned columnist and celebrity author who had won forty million dollars in the New York Lottery, was also there. She had been shopping in Herald Square and then, before going home to Central Park South, had walked down the few blocks to the church to light a candle in front of St. Anthony&#x2019;s Shrine and drop off an extra donation for the breadline because she had just received an unexpected royalty check for her memoir From Pots to Plots.<br> <br>When she saw the man seemingly deep in prayer in front of the shrine, she had paid a visit to the grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes. A few minutes later, when she saw Fr. Aiden, her old friend, leave the Reconciliation Room, she had been about to run up and say a quick hello to him. Then to her astonishment, the man who had seemed so engrossed in prayer suddenly jumped up, his dark glasses raised. No mistake about it, he was watching Fr. Aiden make his way to the door of the Friary.<br> <br>Alvirah dismissed any passing thought that that guy might have wanted to ask Fr. Aiden to hear his confession. He wanted to get a good look at Father, she thought, as she watched the man pull his glasses back over his eyes and turn up the collar of his coat. She had taken off her glasses so he was too far away for her to see him clearly, but from the distance she judged him to be about six feet tall. His face was in the shadows but she could see he was on the thin side. Her impression, when she had passed him at the statue, was that he had no gray in his full head of black hair. He had been covering his face with his hands.<br> <br>Who knows what makes people tick, Alvirah asked herself as she watched the stranger, now moving quickly, exit by the door nearest him. But I&#x2019;ll tell you this much, she thought. As soon as Fr. Aiden left the Reconciliation Room, whatever that guy had to say to St. Anthony, he wound it up fast.</p><h2>Living Without Fear</h2><p><b>A concise yet life-transforming work that will help many people move past the crippling fear that has stopped them from living their destined life. </b> <br><br> Does fear stop you from living your life to the fullest?

Agorism is applied Counter-Economics -- the philosophy of engaging in free-market activities in defiance of government control. An evolution of libertarianism, Agorism embraces all non-coercive human action and opposes all force- or fraud-based attempts to stifle innovation, trade, thought, and wealth. If you have ever suspected that government, academia, and other entities are trying to pull the wool over your eyes in order to control your money, your morality, and your life, you&#39;ll find answers and remedies in AN AGORIST PRIMER. In one concise volume, Samuel Edward Konkin III explains the theory, principles, and -- most important of all -- the practice of Agorism. If you think that consistency between means and ends matters, this is the book for you! From the preface: &#34;Agorism is a way of thinking about the world around you, a method of understanding why things work the way they do, how they do, and how they can be dealt with -- how you can deal with them.&#34; Samuel Edward Konkin III is the author of the seminal work on libertarianism and Agorism: New Libertarian Manifesto. Over the course of thirty years, he wrote, edited, and published newsletters and magazines such as Laissez Faire, New Libertarian Notes, and 101 issues of the longest-running publication of its kind, New Libertarian Weekly. Known to his friends as SEK3, Mr. Konkin graduated cum laude from the University of Alberta, serving as head of the Young Social Credit League there. He received his Masters in Theoretical Chemistry at New York University, but left NYU without submitting his Ph.D. dissertation in Quantum Mechanics to pursue his lifelong efforts to promote Counter-Economics and Agorism. He founded the New Libertarian Alliance, the Movement of the Libertarian Left, and the outreach organization The Agorist Institute. His body of work is available from KoPubCo. PRAISE FOR AN AGORIST PRIMER: &#34;A lot of us have waited two decades for the release of this slender tome... Clocking in at just over 100 pages, An Agorist Primer offers not only a simple-but-thorough explanation of what agorism is, it also builds a rock-solid case for it... But trust me, Konkin&#39;s well-structured argument for a free society of the open marketplace (&#34;as near to untainted by theft, assault, and fraud as can be humanly attained&#34;) is compelling. And he shows convincingly that such a society is absolutely achievable and sustainable. Sam&#39;s book truly is a primer; he strips down heavy-duty economic theory and libertarian philosophy without diminishing either of them. An Agorist Primer may be a quick walk through the basics, but it never shortchanges the reader. And best of all, it&#39;s awfully entertaining.&#34; --Wally Conger, Out of Step</p><p></p><h2>Fanny in France: Travel Adventures of a Chef&#39;s Daughter, with Recipes</h2><p><b>From famed chef Alice Waters, a treat for anyone who loves France, food, adventure&#x2014;or all three!</b><br><br>Fanny is a girl who knows a lot about food and cooking since she&#x2019;s grown up in and around the famous restaurant Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California. When Fanny&#x2019;s mother, Alice Waters, the chef and owner of Chez Panisse, starts to watch her favorite old French movies, Fanny knows soon they&#x2019;ll be packing their bags and traveling to France for a visit. In this sparkling book of whimsical stories, Fanny recounts some of her most fun-filled adventures with French friends and food. Join Fanny as she helps cook a huge <i>bouillabaisse</i> in Provence; learns how to make fresh cheese from a shepherd high up in the Pyrenees mountains; hunts for&nbsp; wild oysters off the coast of Bordeaux, and discovers how one chicken can feed nine people, if served a certain way. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <i>Fanny in France</i> is also a beginner&#x2019;s cookbook with forty simple, French-inspired recipes that encourage children and adults anywhere to cook and share delicious snacks and meals with family and friends using basic methods and the most sustainable ingredients.</p><p><b>Alice Waters</b> is Fanny&#x2019;s mother and the noted chef, restaurateur and proprietor of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California. She was an early advocate for the use of organic and locally grown food in restaurants, and has written a number of books and won numerous awards relating to her philosophy of food and eating. Before being a cook, Alice was a Montessori teacher and this experience inspired her to found the Edible Schoolyard Project whose mission is to create and establish a national edible education curriculum in all public schools &#x2013; kindergarten through college. In 2010, Alice received the prestigious L�gion d&#x2019;honneur from the French government and in 2014 she received the National Humanities Medal.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Bob Carrau</b> is a writer, screenwriter and artist who lives in San Francisco. He collaborated with Alice Waters on <i>Fanny at Chez Panisse</i> and has known Fanny her whole life.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Ann Arnold</b> is a still-life painter. She illustrated Alice Waters&#x2019;s <i>Fanny at Chez Panisse</i> and lives around the corner from the restaurant in Berkeley, California.Gr 3 Up&#x2014;Waters recounts the memories of her nine-year-old daughter, Fanny Waters. Cheerful vignettes evoke Fanny's experiences cooking, eating, and exploring her way around France with her mother and a revolving cast of friends. Fanny helps make a bouillabaisse, tastes fresh sea urchin straight from the sea, and hikes deep into the Pyrenees to observe a shepherd make cheese from sheep's milk. Arnold's gorgeous ink and watercolor illustrations bring the French countryside and many lively meals to life. Despite the clear prose and evocative illustrations, the text conveys a nostalgia and lifestyle typically more attractive to adults than children. Moreover, many of the recipes are long and involve such sophisticated fare as "couscous royale with chermoula." Still, this is an attractive supplement to more traditional nonfiction works about France and French culture and will work well for patrons doing reports or studies in that area. Additionally, young chefs and readers who have mastered Mollie Katzen's cookbooks will be happy to try the more advanced recipes presented here. VERDICT Consider adding to biography and French cookbook collections for sophisticated readers in larger libraries.&#x2014;Kristy Pasquariello, Wellesley Free Library, MA</p><h2>Contemplation: An Islamic Psychospiritual Study (New Edition)</h2><p>In this powerful exploration into the human mind and its relationship with the human spirit, Malik Badri invites the reader to open the door to self-discovery, purpose and spirituality through the practice of contemplation, reflection and meditation - understanding the true meaning and experience of spirituality as well as one s own place in Creation.

In capturing the extent of the higher faculties engaged in tafakkur, he points the way to the reclamation of a spiritually elevated, fully human, and truly holistic vision of Islam that, above all, has the potential to inspire Muslims to follow their higher calling and by so doing to be of service to all mankind. --Dr. Jeremy Henzell-Thomas, Research Associate (and former Visiting Fellow) at theCentre of Islamic Studies, University of Cambridge</p><h2>Ajin 9: Demi-Human (Ajin: Demi-Human)</h2><p>Sato's bitten.

I didn&#x2019;t know I was a feminist because I didn&#x2019;t know I needed to be, and I also didn&#x2019;t think I would still be allowed to wear make-up if I became one. And I seriously loved make-up. I went to school just like my brothers, my mum had a job just like my dad. Feminism was something that we learned about in history class and didn&#x2019;t have to worry about any more. Like telegrams or corsets or the plague, feminism was the stuff of suffragettes and burnt bras and fights that had been won and long forgotten. <br><br>Much like a rare breed of bird, I knew feminists still existed out there in the wild. I also knew I most definitely did not want to be one. For starters, it was the middle of the noughties, and in a world where Beyonc� existed I couldn&#x2019;t fathom what on earth these feminists were fighting for. More importantly my image of a &#x2018;feminist&#x2019; was entirely in opposition to every single priority my fifteen-year-old brain possessed. Feminists didn&#x2019;t use make-up (my favourite hobby). They didn&#x2019;t shave their legs (my favourite form of exercise). Feminists didn&#x2019;t like boys (my favourite type of human) and, most importantly, feminists definitely didn&#x2019;t wear pink. And pink was my favourite colour. Being a feminist would mean disposing of half my wardrobe, revealing my spotty skin and hairy legs to the world and putting an end to the twenty-plus daily MSN messages I sent to boys I had crushes on.<br><br>There&#x2019;s an amazing feminist superhero called Audre Lorde who said: &#x2018;Our feelings are our most genuine paths to knowledge.&#x2019; My nosedive into feminism was fuelled entirely by feelings. In the years since, it has developed and grown into something far wordier, filled with thoughts, books, quotes and plans for action; but at the beginning my feminism was just a feeling. My feminism was born with little context or language and lots of emotion. <br><br>When I was fifteen I was treated very badly by a group of men and a few women who wouldn&#x2019;t have treated me that way if I had been a man. I was a teenage girl with blue dip-dyed hair and a predilection for wearing tutus to hospital appointments. I was very ill and I was misdiagnosed and mistreated for far longer than even an irritating teenager who could probably have done with being knocked down a few pegs deserves to be. I was mistreated and silenced for a number of reasons that only now, nearly a decade on, am I finally beginning to unpick. It happened because I was young, because I was emotionally &#x2018;complicated&#x2019;, but it also happened because I was a girl. And because the person sitting next to me in every waiting room, doctor&#x2019;s office and hospital ward was a woman and a mother. <br><br>In the grand scheme of heinous acts committed by the patriarchy, what happened to me was very small. It was very small and it got better, and I&#x2019;m extremely lucky. But it did&nbsp;happen. And it sparked a feeling inside me; and that feeling began to grow. <br><br>My illness also meant that I spent three years of my life lying in my bedroom with nothing much to do except read and Google and knit small animals. So I began to read. I read Virginia Woolf and Gloria Steinem and Caitlin Moran and then realized they were all white women and I might need to start looking a little further. I read Audre Lorde and Roxane Gay and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and slowly but surely I began to understand and think and see. <br><br>I began to understand that what had happened to me was a small ripple that took place in an ocean of pain, movement and change. I began to understand that gender equality was not in fact a thing of the past but a far-off dream for the future. A dream that generations of women and men had been fighting for and continued to fight for every single day. <br><br>Once I began to understand that, I also began to understand that the assumptions I had held about what it meant to be a feminist were in fact a tool of the very systems of hate that these women were trying to smash. This system of hate (also known as &#x2018;the patriarchy&#x2019;) had concocted an image of a feminist precisely so young women would be deterred from continuing the fight. The lies we have been told about feminism have been fed to us to hold us back from a movement that is actually for everyone. A movement that is more beautiful and&nbsp;more potentially powerful than we could ever have dreamed. As I began to read I began to understand that feminists do in fact wear make-up (if they want to). They also shave their legs (if they want to) and love boys (if they want to). Feminists can also definitely wear pink, a lot of pink. <br><br>The women&#x2019;s movement has been alive and kicking for a very long time now. It is a beautiful and complicated timeline of people, theories, words and books that are constantly defining and redefining what it means to be a feminist. This book is not an academic textbook. It is not a manual on how to be a perfect feminist or a book of essays by professors of women&#x2019;s studies explaining the history of the movement. Those books exist, and many of them are brilliant, but that is not what this book is.<br><br> This book is a book of feelings that are transforming into thoughts that are transforming into action. Most of the amazing women who have contributed to this book probably don&#x2019;t know much more about feminism than you do. Most of the women are just at the starting line of the lifelong journey to discover what it means to be a feminist and to fight the feminist fight. This book is not here to tell you everything you need to know about feminism, it&#x2019;s here to show you that at the heart of feminism is women. Women who are complex and complicated, who wear make-up and wear pink and laugh and cry and get confused just like you. This book is here&nbsp;to hopefully show you that being a feminist isn&#x2019;t quite what you thought it was. <br><br>While my fifteen-year-old self was wrong about a lot of things, she was right about one thing. Feminists are rare birds. They are rare birds who fly above us, trying to look down and see the world for what it is. They look down and see the mountains that our world will have to overcome if freedom is ever going to be possible, and then they fly back down to earth to help us all with the climb. I am a feminist. And boy do I wear pink.</p><h2>Making Loss Matter : Creating Meaning in Difficult Times</h2><p>Some losses are so subtle they go unnoticed, some so overwhelming and cruel they seem unbearable. Coping with grief and experiencing loss&nbsp;overwhelms us in ways that seem&nbsp;both hopeless and endless.&nbsp;In painful moments like these, we must make a choice: Will we allow the difficulties we face to become forces of destruction in our lives, or will we find a way to begin learning from loss,&nbsp;transforming our suffering into a source of strength?<br><br>A theologian with the heart of a poet, <b>Rabbi David Wolpe </b>explores the meaning of loss, and the way we can use its inevitable appearance in our lives as a source of strength rather than a source of despair. In this national bestseller, Wolpe creates a remarkably fluid account of how we might find a way out of overwhelming feelings of helplessness and instead begin understanding grief in all its forms and learn to&nbsp;create meaning in difficult times.</p><p><b>David J. Wolpe</b> is the Max Webb Senior Rabbi at Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, California, and has been named the most influential rabbi in America by <i>Newsweek</i> and one of the 50 most influential Jews in the world by the <i>Jerusalem Post</i>. He has taught at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, the American Jewish University in Los Angeles, Hunter College, and the University of California, Los Angeles. Wolpe, a weekly columnist for <i>Time.com</i>, has been published and profiled in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and the <i>Jewish Week</i>. He is the author of eight books, including the national bestseller <i>Making Loss Matter: Creating Meaning in Difficult Times</i>.Early in his book, Wolpe, rabbi of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, shares a sobering thought: "Losses are the stuff of life. They will not miss you, they will not steer around those whom you love." The author's search for meaningful ways to deal with loss came soon after his wife, Ellie, was diagnosed with cancer. He admits that his "life was suddenly full of shadows," and he feared that his vibrant wife might die. As Wolpe struggles with his fear of loss and with the daily crises brought by Ellie's illness, he realizes that facing loss requires courage and love. Although he had been writing this book before his wife's illness, her cancer gave him a new perspective on facing suffering. Wolpe uses personal anecdotes, ancient stories of suffering and joy, the sagacious parables of rabbis and the wisdom of poets and philosophers to explore the nature of loss and the ways we can respond meaningfully to it. He notes that throughout life we experience a variety of losses, some trivial and others grave, such as the loss of home, dreams, self, faith, love and life. On the loss of dreams, for instance, Wolpe writes, "Dreams can ennoble us even when they fail.... Each dream can be a step on the ladder we climb in order to become the person we were meant to be." In order for loss to be meaningful, he contends, we must not run from it but incorporate its scars deeply in our lives, face it with faith and courage and celebrate the new identities that we derive from our experience. Although Wolpe really offers no new ideas about coping with loss, his easy manner and eloquent storytelling will help readers suffering from loss feel as if they have found a companion on their journeys.

None worked, and some exacted a staggering human toll. Then, after two centuries of wishful thinking and bitter disappointment, socialism imploded in a <i>fin de si�cle</i> drama of falling walls and collapsing regimes. It was an astonishing denouement but what followed was no less astonishing. After the hiatus of a couple of decades, new voices were raised, as if innocent of all that had come before, proposing to try it all over again.<br><br> Joshua Muravchik traces the pursuit of this phantasm, presenting sketches of the thinkers and leaders who developed the theory, led it to power, and presided over its collapse, as well as those who are trying to revive it today. <i>Heaven on Earth</i> is a story filled with character and event while at the same time giving us an epic chronicle of a movement that tried to turn the world upside down&#x2015;and for a time succeeded.</p><p>Joshua Muravchik is the author of hundreds of articles appearing in major U.S. newspapers and intellectual magazines, and eleven books including <i>Making David into Goliath: How the World Turned Against Israel</i>; <i>Exporting Democracy: Fulfilling America's Destiny</i>; <i>The Imperative of American Leadership: A Challenge to Neo-Isolationism</i>; and <i>Trailblazers of the Arab Spring: Voices of Democracy in the Middle East</i>.&#x201c;This is contemporary history at its best.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;<i>Choice</i><br><br> &#x201c;An illuminating history that traces the great and not-so-great individuals who made socialism happen.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br> &#x201c;It is hard to find a book on the history of socialism that is either readable or accurate, so it is especially remarkable to find one that is both....

Quantum leaps in technology are enabling organizations to observe and measure people&#x2019;s behavior in real time, communicate internally at extraordinary speed, and innovate continuously. These new, software-driven technologies are transforming the way companies interact with their customers, employees, and other stakeholders.<br><br>This is no mere tech issue. The transformation requires a complete rethinking of the way we organize and manage work. And, as software becomes ever more integrated into every product and service, making this big shift is quickly becoming the key operational challenge for businesses of all kinds. We need a management model that doesn&#x2019;t merely account for, but actually embraces, continuous change. Yet the truth is, most organizations continue to rely on outmoded, industrial-era operational models. They structure their teams, manage their people, and evolve their organizational cultures the way they always have.<br><br>Now, organizations are emerging, and thriving, based on their capacity to sense and respond instantly to customer and employee behaviors. In <i>Sense and Respond</i>, Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden, leading tech experts and founders of the global Lean UX movement, vividly show how these companies operate, highlighting the new mindset and skills needed to lead and manage them and to continuously innovate within them.<br><br>In illuminating and instructive business examples, you&#x2019;ll see organizations with distinctively new operating principles: shifting from managing outputs to what the authors call outcome-focused management&#x201d;; forming self-guided teams that can read and react to a fast-changing environment; creating a learning-all-the-time culture that can understand and respond to new customer behaviors and the data they generate; and finally, developing in everyone at the company the new universal skills of customer listening, assessment, and response.<br><br>This engaging and practical book provides the crucial new operational and management model to help you and your organization win in a world of continuous change.<br></p><p><b>Jeff Gothelf</b> is a lean-thinking and design evangelist, spreading the gospel of great team collaboration, product innovation, and evidence-based decision making.

Its walls are rich with stories. Its walls are rich with stories. In this book we hear myriad of those voices. First we follow a young person today. Her great-great-grandmother entered America through Ellis Island. As this young girl walks the halls of the famous site, she wonders about the past, the people, and their hopes, dreams and challenges. <br> <br> Here, too, is the voice of Sera, an Armenian girl from the early 1900s. Fleeing the unthinkable in her home country, she longs to join her father in America. As Sera enters the halls of Ellis Island, she <i>lives</i> those same hopes, dreams, and challenges. <br> <br> The voices of real immigrants -- their suffering in steerage, their first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty, and their journey through the Great Hall -- complete this touching look into an important part of America's history. A pivotal time and place is brought to life through a combination of many voices speaking in harmony.</p><p><b>Louise Peacock</b>, who has always been interested in history, took a PhD in medieval studies before turning to children's liturature. Her first book, <i>Crossing the Delaware</i>, was inspired by a trip with her son to Washington's Crossing.

Dr. Peacock lives in Haslett, Michigan.<br><br><b>Walter Lyon Krudop</b> was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1966. He had his first painting lesson when he was eight years old and later studied illustration at the School of Visual Arts in New York. He has illustrated a number of books for young readers, including <i>The Good-Night Kiss</i> and <i>Wake Up, Little Children</i> by Jim Aylesworth; <i>Black Whiteness</i> by Robert Burleigh; and <i>Crossing the Delaware</i> by Louise Peacock. He lives with his wife, Sara, in New York City.Nearly 100 years ago, Sura, 10, fleeing the Armenian genocide, writes letters to her lost mother about her voyage and the struggle to get past inspectors and join her father in America. Visiting Ellis Island today, a young girl thinks of her great-great-grandmother coming through in the rush of immigrants long ago. Terse, boxed, archival quotes by real immigrants from all over Europe and moving sepia-tone photos extend the two fictionalized narratives. The constant switch in viewpoints is sometimes confusing, especially the contemporary child's overview, but the facts are as dramatic as the fiction, and Krudop's full-color gouache pictures extend Sura's story, showing the crowded ship, the exciting and confusing landing, the terrifying interrogations, and, finally, the reunion with Papa. Many readers will find connections with their own family stories, whether in the past or coming here today. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Going back just a little further, to the beginning of the 19th century, the holiday Jane Austen knew would have looked distinctly odd to modern sensibilities. How odd? Families rarely decorated Christmas trees. Festivities centered on socializing instead of gift-giving. Festivities focused on adults, with children largely consigned to the nursery. Holiday events, including balls, parties, dinners, and even weddings celebrations, started a week before Advent and extended all the way through to Twelfth Night in January. Take a step into history with Maria Grace as she explores the traditions, celebrations, games and foods that made up Christmastide in Jane Austen's era. Packed with information and rich with detail from period authors, Maria Grace transports the reader to a longed-for old fashioned Christmas.

A wave of unfamiliar energy licked against her skin, testing her boundaries as though searching for a way into her.<br> <br>The Book.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d tried to explain&#x2014;tried to warn her after she had returned from the future he&#x2019;d sent her to, a future he&#x2019;d thought was safe. All that power is in me, he&#x2019;d said.<br> <br>She hadn&#x2019;t understood. Until now.<br> <br>Now the familiar warmth of his affinity was overwhelmed by a stronger magic, a power that had once been contained in the pages of the Ars Arcana the Thief had tucked into her skirts&#x2014;a book that people she loved had lied and fought and died for. Now its power was beginning to creep upward, wrapping around her wrist, solid and heavy as the silver cuff she wore on her arm.<br> <br>At the edges of her consciousness, the Thief thought she heard voices whispering.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop it,&#x201d; she told him through clenched teeth.<br> <br>His response came out clipped, strained. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying.&#x201d;<br> <br>When she looked over at him, his expression was pained, but his eyes were bright, their irises flashing with colors she could not have named. He drew in a breath, his nostrils flaring slightly with the effort, and a moment later the colors in his eyes faded until they were his usual stormy gray. The warmth vining around her arm receded, and the voices she&#x2019;d heard scratching at the boundaries of her mind went quiet.<br> <br>Together they began to walk. Away from their city, their only home. Away from her regrets and failures.<br> <br>As they passed the first set of brick and steel arches, each step was one more toward their possible end. This close to the Brink, its cold energy warned anyone with an affinity for the old magic to stay away. The Thief could feel it, could sense those icy tendrils of corrupted power clawing at her, at the very heart of what she was.<br> <br>But the warning didn&#x2019;t stop her.<br> <br>Too much had happened. Too many people had been lost, and all because she had been willing to believe in the comfort of lies and too easily led. It was a mistake she wouldn&#x2019;t repeat. The truth of who and what she was had seared her, burning away all the lies she&#x2019;d once accepted. About her world. About herself.<br> <br>That blaze had cauterized her aching regrets and left her a girl of fire. A girl of ash and scars. She carried a taste in her mouth that made her think of vengeance. It stiffened her resolve and kept her feet moving. Because after everything that had happened, all that she had learned, she had nothing left to lose.<br> <br>She had everything left to lose.<br> <br>Brushing aside the dark thought, the Thief took a deep, steadying breath and found the spaces between the seconds that hung suspended around her. Once she had not thought of time, or her ability to manipulate it, as anything particularly special. She knew better now. Time was the quintessence of existence&#x2014;Aether&#x2014;the substance that held the world together. Now she appreciated the way she could sense everything&#x2014;the air and the light, matter itself&#x2014;tugging against the net of time.<br> <br>How could she have missed this? It was all so startlingly clear.<br> <br>The streetcar&#x2019;s bell clanged out its warning again, and this time she didn&#x2019;t hesitate to use her affinity to pull the seconds until they ran slow. As the world went still around her, the rumble of the streetcar died away into silence. And the Thief&#x2019;s breath caught in a strangled gasp.<br> <br>&#x201c;Esta?&#x201d; the Magician asked, fear cracking his voice. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you see it?&#x201d; she asked, not bothering to hide her wonder.<br> <br>Before her the Brink shimmered in the light of the setting sun, its power fluctuating haphazardly in ribbons of energy. Visible. Almost solid. They were every color she had ever imagined and some she didn&#x2019;t have names for. Like the colors that had flashed in the Magician&#x2019;s eyes, they were beautiful. Terrible.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; she told the Magician, leading him toward the barrier. She could see the path they would take, the spaces between the coiling tendrils of power that would let them slide through untouched.<br> <br>They were in the middle of the swirling colors, the Magician&#x2019;s hand like a vise around hers, cold and damp with his fear, when she noticed the darkness. It started at the edges of her vision, like the black spots you see after a flash of light. Nothing more than wisps at first, the darkness slowly bled into her vision like ink in water.<br> <br>Before, the spaces between the seconds had been easy to find and grab hold of, but now they seemed to be slipping away, the substance of them dissolving as if eaten by the same darkness filling her vision.<br> <br>&#x201c;Run,&#x201d; she said as she felt her hold on time slipping.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; The Magician looked over at her, his eyes now shadowed with the creeping blackness as well.<br> <br>She stumbled, her legs suddenly like rubber beneath her. The cold power of the Brink was sliding against her skin like a blade. Everything was going dark, and the world around her was fading into nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Run!&#x201d;</p><h2>Find the Poo: Without Worrying About Where You Step</h2><p><p> <i>The dog's done his bit. Your job is to find what he's left behind.</i> </p><p> For years Joe Shyllit has struggled, like all dog owners, with sometimes having trouble finding his dog's poo. A dog's poo can hide almost anywhere. </p><p> If he just couldn't find it, Shyllit would either do a fake pick-up or steel his nerves and walk away -- a crime punishable by deathly dirty looks. Dog owners are a tough bunch. </p><p> One day Shyllit decided that he would take photographs of the places where he could not find the poo but knew it was there. And so, <i>Find the Poo</i> was born, an odor-free challenge to find the poo in 22 sharp color photographs. Driveway gravel, autumn leaves, tree bark, red stones, roots, undergrowth, dappled sunlight, tiny pine cones -- all are hiding a contribution from Shyllit's 10-year-old cockapoo, Farfel. </p><p> Unlike real life, however, the answers are at the back of the book. Consider them training for the next time you walk your dog. </p></p><p><p> Joe Shyllit is an advertising creative director, who has won several international awards in the ad industry. He graduated from the Ontario College of Art and with Jerry Kuleba formed the creative ad agency Kuleba and Shyllit, winning several awards from around the world. In 2015, Kuleba passed away and Shyllit returned to illustration and design with his series called "Knowhereman." He lives in Toronto, Ontario, with his dog, Farfel. </p>This incredibly clever, beautifully crafted little gem of a photography book is full of crap. Crap as in dog poop hiding in 22 full color, suitable for framing photos of mini landscapes where dogs can hide what we euphemistically call their business. (Jan Williams <i>The Poodle (and Dog) Blog</i> 2019-04-19)<br><br>My new favourite book... My human brother and his school friends found it hilarious and had lots of fun finding all the poos that are hiding in different places. My human mother said that it's actually very good practice for finding my poos in real life, and that we should give it to my human father for his birthday. (<i>Cockapoo Sunny</i> 2019-06-08)<br><br>This hilarious (and surprisingly challenging!) search-and-find book is the perfect, odourless way to train your eyes to detect poo. (Connie's Book Club <i>Modern Dog</i> 2019-03-01)<br><br>There are autumn leaves. There are spring leaves. There are garden flowers, tree bark, mushroom-decorated lawns, scattered small stones (perhaps a beach?) and wood-chip landscapes that resemble Jackson Pollack paintings... Reading the book is a delight, and much more fun than walking Farfel and picking up his gifts. I think this would be a fun book to read with your children or grandchildren, if there is a dog in your extended family... Recommended.

But destiny took a hand the day he met Gwen Cooper, and with the publication twelve years later of the international best seller "Homer&#x2019;s Odyssey," Homer went from beloved housecat to world-wide star. He became the scourge and darling of the reporters, photographers, videographers, bloggers, and radio hosts who clamored to meet him&#x2014;dragging his hapless human behind him as he greeted fame with his usual joie de vivre and occasional &#x201c;catitude.&#x201d; He became a spokes-cat for the cause of special-needs animals everywhere, and eventually the wise older mentor to the new special-needs kitten who would enter his and Gwen&#x2019;s lives. Most importantly, Homer taught those who loved him best how to live and die with strength, dignity, and joy&#x2014;and left behind a rescue community of &#x201c;Homer&#x2019;s Heroes&#x201d; that continues to save countless lives in his name. By turns humorous and tender, this beautifully written, 115-page sequel concludes the adventures of Homer the Blind Wonder Cat&#x2014;the fearless feline who proved that love isn&#x2019;t something you see with your eyes, that even the smallest of creatures can make a big difference, and that true love lives forever.</p><p>Gwen Cooper is the New York Times bestselling author of the memoir &#34;Homer&#39;s Odyssey: A Fearless Feline Tale, or How I Learned About Love and Life with a Blind Wonder Ca&#34;t; the novels &#34;Love Saves the Day&#34; and &#34;Diary of a South Beach Party Girl&#34;; and the crowd-sourced collection of cat selfies, &#34;Kittenish&#34;, 100% of the proceeds from which were donated to support animal rescue in Nepal following the 2015 earthquake. She is a frequent speaker at shelter fundraisers and donates 10% of her royalties from &#34;Homer&#39;s Odyssey&#34; to organizations that serve abused, abandoned, and disabled animals. She also manages Homer&#39;s ongoing social-media community, which reaches nearly two million cat enthusiasts and rescuers around the world each day. Gwen lives in Manhattan with her husband, Laurence. She also lives with her two perfect cats--Clayton the Tripod and his litter-mate, Fanny--who aren&#39;t impressed with any of it.</p><h2>The Liturgy Explained: New Edition</h2><p>This completely new work replaces the best-selling but woefully outdated Morehouse classic by the same name.

How do they breathe? They don't have noses."</i> </p><p>And so begins a conversation between the author and her daughter that leads to a remarkable discovery: Trees are like children in so many ways! They may look very different from people, but trees have roots that hold them to the ground like feet and leaves that blow in the wind like hair. Their bark even comes in different colors, just like our skin. </p><p>From this poetic comparison of plants and humans, readers will learn how trees live and grow, and how they get their food. They will learn about the baobab trees of Africa, the banyan trees of India, and the bristlecone pines of California. They will see, through Stacey Schuett's exquisite art, that trees come in all shapes and sizes-just like people-and provide a home to many different animals. But most of all, they will look at trees with greater respect and a bit of awe, after realizing that trees are alive too.</p></p><p><p><b>Debbie Miller</b> has written many acclaimed children's books, including <i>Arctic Lights, Arctic Nights</i>. She lives in Fairbanks, Alaska. <br><b>Stacey Schuett</b> has illustrated many popular books for children, including her own <i>Somewhere in the World Right Now</i>. From her studio window, she enjoys a view of her backyard, home to many oak, redwood, and fruit trees. Stacey lives in Northern California.</p>reSchool-Grade 2-Using comparisons to the human body, Miller describes the characteristics of trees. In simple but poetic terms, she compares the veins of a leaf to those in a person's hand. She tells readers that the tree trunk supports the tree as our legs support us, and that "Bark is dark or light, rough or smooth, thick or thin, just like people's skin." Children can travel the globe, examining common and unusual trees-a weeping willow in China, a baobab in Africa, Australia's ribbon gum, the paper birch of North America, India's banyan tree, etc. The vibrant acrylic-and-gouache illustrations are scientifically accurate and inviting, and the people depicted reflect the cultures of the trees' locations. Illustrated notes at the back of the book explain where they grow and their relative sizes and ages. The trees are also displayed on a map on the colorful endpapers.

But the disastrous Allied airborne landing in Holland, American setbacks on the German border and in the H�rtgen Forest, together with the bitter Battle of the Bulge, drastically altered that timetable. Hastings tells the story of both the Eastern and Western Fronts, and paints a vivid portrait of the Red Army&#x2019;s onslaught on Hitler&#x2019;s empire. He has searched the archives of the major combatants and interviewed 170 survivors to give us an unprecedented understanding of how the great battles were fought, and of their human impact on American, British, German, and Russian soldiers and civilians.&nbsp;<br><br>Hastings raises provocative questions: Were the Western Allied cause and campaign compromised by a desire to get the Soviets to do most of the fighting? Why were the Russians and Germans more effective soldiers than the Americans and British? Why did the bombing of Germany&#x2019;s cities continue until the last weeks of the war, when it could no longer influence the outcome? Why did the Germans prove more fanatical foes than the Japanese, fighting to the bitter end? This book also contains vivid portraits of Stalin, Churchill, Eisenhower, Montgomery, and the other giants of the struggle.&nbsp;<br><br>The crucial final months of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest global conflict come alive in this rousing and revelatory chronicle.</p></p><p>In September 1944, the Allies believed that Hitler's army was beaten and expected the bloodshed to end by Christmas. Yet a series of mistakes and setbacks, including the Battle of the Bulge, drastically altered this timetable and led to eight more months of brutal fighting. <br>With Armageddon," the eminent military historian Max Hastings gives us memorable accounts of the great battles and captures their human impact on soldiers and civilians. He tells the story of both the Eastern and Western Fronts, raising provocative questions and offering vivid portraits of the great leaders.

I have known this former deputy attorney general of the United States for twenty-five years, and because I am on the board of a Boys &amp; Girls Club in the South Bronx, I am also a member of his board of advisers. We happened to run into each other the way New Yorkers often meet, in unlikely places&#x2014;in our case, sitting in a laboratory anteroom, waiting to have our blood drawn for annual exams. Suddenly, a nurse enters and exclaims that a plane has crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at my watch.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 8:48 a.m.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Manhattan most people arrive at their offices ten or fifteen minutes early. Many have carried little white bags from local coffee shops, and are just now taking seats at their desks, anticipating the day's work. How many people are already in the World Trade Center? It must be thousands and thousands. What a terrible accident this threatens to be.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I picture the firefighters now responding to the alarm. I know what they are thinking. They are thinking of conditions. For every fire, however, the conditions can never be truly imagined until you arrive on the scene. I remember that from all the alarms I have responded to in my own life. Thousands. Each time there is the anticipation. I never knew what would meet us at the alarm location, never knew what had to be done, just as these firefighters now do not know. A report of a plane's going into a building is just the first part of the story.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a retired New York City firefighter, and an honorary assistant chief of department. Engine Co. 82 and Ladder 31 in the South Bronx, where I worked from 1967 through 1973, were then among the busiest fire companies in the city. I am on the board of directors of several fire-related not-for-profits, and I am chairman of a foundation that seeks to improve the health and safety of firefighters. I have never lost contact with my friends in the fire service since my retirement in 1981, and I feel still very much a part of "the brotherhood." Indeed, once a member of its ranks, I don't believe one ever leaves them. Friends call me "brother" all the time.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9:03 I arrive home to find my wife, Katina, staring in shock at the television. Another plane has just gone into the south tower.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second crash leaves no doubt that we have been attacked, so many thoughts begin to flow through my mind. This is no accident. As every American must be doing at this moment, I wonder: Who would do this? Who could pull off something this horrendous? This is not as simple an act as parking a truck loaded with 7000 pounds of fertilizing chemicals in front of a federal building in Oklahoma City. No, this could only have been the result of the carefully plotted efforts of a group, and it would have to have been supported by a government or some organization with very big money. And people would have to have been willing to effect their own deaths. Like the kamikazes. But where were the kamikazes today? Just one place that I know of. Only the terrorists of the Middle East would do this. They had tried before, in February 1993, and now they have come back to try again.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give it a little time," I say, "and then I have to go down there."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the drill, for I have been to similar emergencies. I can picture what the scene will be like at the crash site. It is a major disaster, and will be crowded with professionals&#x2014;firefighters, cops, emergency medical technicians, nurses, and doctors. During the first hour of operations fire department personnel will be rushing from place to place. To an outsider it might seem like pandemonium, but it will be controlled and orchestrated by people who know fully what they are doing.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pumpers will be connecting to hydrants; ladder trucks will be positioning their aerial platforms; roof men, can men, irons men, and engine men will all be helping, lifting, carrying people out of the buildings. Chiefs of every rank will respond. There will be battalion chiefs who wear golden oak leafs, division chiefs who wear golden eagles, division commanders who wear one gold star, deputy assistant chiefs who wear two gold stars, and assistant chiefs who wear three gold stars. Each will have a specific job, each will direct personnel to preassigned duties in evacuation, rescue, or firefighting. The chief in charge, probably Pete Ganci, the chief of department, a circle of five gold stars on his collar, will be setting up his command post in accordance with prefire plans at the fire control panels in the lobby of the first building hit. He will begin to divide the emergency into grid sectors, and assign areas of responsibility. His aide chiefs will be generating blueprints, computer images of specific floor plans and elevator banks, prefire evacuation plans, and personnel assignments on each alarm transmitted. There will be lists of each of the three engine companies and two ladder companies that will respond to each alarm as it is transmitted. How many alarms will there be? I ask myself. Five alarms is normally as big as it gets. But this is not "normally." A situation requiring more than five alarms used to be transmitted during my years on active duty as a "borough call." But now the department's Starfire computer system not only makes the first five alarm assignments, but also tracks and moves the nearest ninety engine companies and forty ladder companies to the fire&#x2014;a force equivalent to twenty-two alarms. Whatever it is called, it will be like a borough call, I think, and companies will come from the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder about the conditions. What is the heat like below the fire, going up to it? Heat rises, but there is also radiated heat to consider. How hot is it above? Will the men be able to do a search above the fire? What is the integrity of the stairwells? Can people get down from the floors above? What is the strength of the ceilings and floors?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thousands of people working in those buildings. Will the evacuation be orderly? Is there enough room to carry equipment like stretchers, hose, Stokes baskets, generators, ropes, and ladders up the stairwells while hordes are coming down? These are all questions that must be going through the mind of the chief of department, if he is there, or the chief in charge, in addition to assessments of firefighting tactics. Is the standpipe system in working order? Is there electricity? Are there fail-safe generators? Are any of the elevators operable to at least get the hose and heavy equipment up? How will the wind affect the burning? Do we go in from the north side of the building or the south? What is the possibility of an inverted burn, in which fire travels downward in high-rise buildings? At which floors do I place my command stations? How many chiefs do I have? Where will I put the staging areas?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irony of "twin" towers does not escape me, for they present two major incidents to the fire department, one in each of the buildings. I know that rescue will be the paramount concern. Will this prove to be the most serious rescue operation in our history?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helicopters are certain to be dispatched to pick people off the roofs, but I wonder about the thermal columns. Can a helicopter get close enough to drop a rope and a man? If the fire is too great, they can't place the people on the street at risk if the chopper falls.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see now on the television just how much fire is coming out of the buildings. Entire floors are involved. I've been in the World Trade Center many times, and I know precisely what is involved. There are many large areas with no interior columns, lots of open space for a fire to burn freely. This would be a five alarm call even if only one building were involved. Besides the helicopters, all the special equipment companies will respond&#x2014;the hazmat team, the squad companies, the rescue companies, the mask service unit, the high-rise unit, the field communications units, the foam unit, and the fire boats. There will be no need of volunteers like me. This is a fire and rescue operation, and New York has twelve thousand firefighters. Within an hour, I am estimating, the operations will have been planned, the defenses put in place, and the rescues and evacuations will be under way. Thereafter, there might be a need for assistance both in caring for the injured and cleaning up.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am attached to the television as if every friend I ever had is about to cross the screen. The helicopter shots are mesmerizing. In my mind's eye I try to visualize what is happening in the towers as I see the flames shooting from their sides. How many have been killed by the impact of the planes, and how many have been burned by the fires? How many will be living, and how many will be dead? How many will be trapped on the fire floor, above the fire, and below the fire in collapsed areas? And the firefighters? How many flights of stairs will they have to run up, and how many minutes will it take them to reach the fire floors? How many firefighters are at this very minute racing into the buildings to get to those who need help?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many will be caught above the fires? It looks like there are ten stories above the fire in the north tower that haven't been hit directly by the plane, and maybe twenty-five stories above the fire in the south tower. Oh, my God, I cry to myself. How many people are on each floor? An acre each floor. Maybe two hundred or more? Thousands. And what will they do? Did the planes take out the fire stairs? The fire will go right up the wells, like a chimney. No one will be able to get to the roof. Maybe the only way they can be saved is by extinguishing the fire and bringing ladders in. That will take hours, maybe days. It is so hot above a fire. I have been there many times in the tenements of the Bronx, hot and dangerous. And if the stairs are out, the situation will be untenable. How many are trapped at this very moment, trying to come to grips with their own end?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many? It is a natural reaction to contemplate the numbers. But I know that I must think only of the individuals affected. Even one person is too many to be in the presence of such mortal danger, yet I know that fundamental to this terrible incident will be the numbers.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat must be extraordinary, generated by airplanes with fuel-filled wings. I remember a question on the lieutenant's test of many years ago: What is the expansion factor of a one-hundred-foot steel beam as it reaches the inherent heat level of 1200 degrees Fahrenheit? The answer is nine and a half inches, and I try to gauge how hot this fire before me is burning. Is it intense enough to bring the steel to 1200 degrees? The smoke is first very black, indicating the burning fuel, and then white as it rises, indicating great heat. It is not a good sign. If the steel stretches, the floor will collapse, and that will only make the rescue effort more difficult.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at the beginning of a war, I think as I begin to change my clothes. No one could send two planes into our largest buildings without a grander plan, and I fear there will be more to follow this disaster.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find an old Engine Co. 82 T-shirt, an FDNY sweatshirt, jeans, and heavy black hiking shoes. This is just about the same kind of uniform I wore when I used to work on Engine 82 in the days before bunker gear, neck protectors, sixty-minute air tanks, and personal alert devices. I make certain to bring my badge with the department's picture identification card, certain there will be tight security everywhere I go today.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9:45 a third plane goes into the Pentagon, and I begin to make my way to a firehouse.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of an enemy's attacking us in the innocence of our early morning is repellent. The Pentagon&#x2014;the very heart of our military strength. How could they have stolen these planes? The question vibrates within me. How could they have gotten onto our planes with guns or weapons? Why didn't someone notice what they were doing, or suspect them? But it is not like us, we Americans, to be suspicious. It is our optimism that prevents us from attributing evil intentions to others; it is our need to protect the rights of everyone that leads us to think the best of people. And that is our strength, actually; this basic freedom to walk around freely without suspicion makes America what it is. But it is that very attitude that also leaves us so vulnerable. One might argue that the price we pay to protect our freedoms is to be tolerant of strangers. All any American needs to do is to look around his community to recognize that we are indeed a nation of strangers. Our cultural diversity is so great that even our good friends and professional colleagues have cultural traits and assumptions that we do not share, or even understand. That is the way it should be in an open society. But how do I explain to myself, and to my children, that our freedoms have led to this horrible event?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It angers me; I want to know whom to blame. I am certain, deep in my heart, that this attack is connected to the first attempt on the World Trade Center back in 1993. Ramzi Yousef, who planned that bombing, and his cohort, the blind sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, are today in federal prison. The sheikh has been in Springfield, Missouri, since 1995, serving several life sentences. Yousef was sentenced to 240 years in a maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado. I remember how defiant and remorseless they were, and that memory only serves to anger me even more.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can shake that feeling only by picturing the firefighters climbing up those stairs in the highest buildings in New York. It is a tough climb in any circumstance, but they will have mask tanks on their backs and hose and tools in their hands, equipment that will make them about sixty pounds heavier. It takes a person with exceptional commitment to do this, and I know it will not be easy for them. I am thinking about this as I go down the elevator in my building. How easy it is for some of us, and how difficult for others. On Lexington Avenue the streets are packed with people. The trains have stopped, the buses are not stopping at the bus stops. I must find some way to get down to the World Trade Center.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A killing storm of terrorism has transformed our lives.

Opal carefully places it under her pillow and hopes the tooth fairy will bring her a shiny quarter. Worried that the tooth fairy might get lost on the way, Puddle puts on a special costume so that Opal won&#39;t be disappointed. But will the real tooth fairy show up after all?</p><p>Holly Hobbie is the author and illustrator of the highly acclaimed Toot &amp; Puddle picture book series, as well as <i>Fanny</i>, <i>Fanny &amp; Annabelle</i>, and <i>Everything but the Horse</i>. The mother of grown children, she lives with her husband in Conway, Massachusetts.<br>PreSchool-Grade 1-Puddle's cousin Opal comes to visit Woodcock Pocket in Hobbie's latest piglet adventure. With her gamine smile, Mary Janes, sunbonnet, and pink femininity, she's a charmer and delights in playing with Toot and Puddle. The loose tooth that she has been wriggling and wobbling suddenly falls out and disappears and Puddle wrestles with the necessity of a visit from the Tooth Fairy. Does the Tooth Fairy truly come to Woodcock Pocket? Hobbie's story and humorous and expressive watercolor illustrations are perfectly tuned-in to her audience. (How does the Tooth Fairy know where to go when someone with a lost tooth is away from home?) The sight of Puddle's earnest Tooth Fairy costume with a shower-curtain gown and clothes-hanger wings will warm readers' hearts.

He lives in Columbia, Missouri.Along this fossil highway, even though it lies in the bottomlands <br>that have always belonged mostly to the trees, I am walking in the <br>time of the birth of the tallgrass prairie, that epoch when turfy <br>perennials - bluestems and gramas, panicums and ryes - began covering <br>the American interior as the old sea, now turned to a limestone <br>anchor, once did. Down in here, the rock is the worn concrete, yet, <br>as hard as it is, the cement road is nevertheless a fissured seedbed, <br>a string of a glade full of brand-new prairie, an extinct highway <br>giving birth to grassland.<br><br>Now: I've walked half this remnant, and I've found big bluestem and <br>little bluestem, silvery bluestem, cord grass, wild rye, sunflower, <br>bundle flower, catclaw sensitive briar, and also plants of the <br>woodlands, including a clump of garden iris from I don't know where. <br>But this strip is not a relict Pleistocene prairie because there <br>probably never was much grass in this low spot in the bottoms: a <br>vestigial highway, yes, but a new prairie. The native forbs and <br>grasses have come in on the wind and maybe on the floods, and now <br>they have roots under the pavement, and soon the prairie plants will <br>need fire to clear away the shading and moisture-sucking trees, and <br>until then the infant prairie can do little more than begin.<br><br>Prairie birth: in an earlier time, men believed the grasslands came <br>as a consequence of infertile ground, or an absence of coarse soil <br>material, or from glaciation, from bison trampling, lightning fires, <br>Indian fires, from persistent wind, drought, temperature extremes.<br><br>But Chase County has good soil of various composition, the ice sheets <br>did not reach here, and the temperature range and rainfall differ <br>only a little from the woodlands of Missouri. The other "reasons" - <br>fire, wind, grazing - contribute less to the birth of prairie than to <br>its maintenance. No: the source of the prairie is its midcontinental <br>position, far from tempering seas, where it lies under an eolian <br>cleavage zone that mixes westerlies, wrung dry by the Rocky <br>Mountains, with humid air from the Gulf: here, inches of evaporation <br>and precipitation are nearly equal, and here, above my head, the rain-<br>shadow of the Rockies meets in commensurate strength the humid Gulf <br>fronts so that this land can grow ten-foot grasses and ninety-foot <br>sycamores, and which one prevails depends mostly on one thing: fire. <br>In the last half-century, the balance has careened toward trees <br>because white men have suppressed the keeper of the grasses. To the <br>prairie, the voice of the Great Mysterious speaks in three tongues: <br>water, wind, flame. This glade beginning in the abandoned highway has <br>heard the first two, and now this slender quarter mile of incipient <br>prairie could use a tossed cigarette from a Santa Fe trackman so that <br>the highway can flourish as never before.<br><br>Copyright (C)1992 by William Least Heat-Moon.

Finkelstein moves from an interrogation of the place the Holocaust has come to occupy in global culture to a disturbing examination of recent Holocaust compensation settlements. It was not until the Arab&#x2013;Israeli War of 1967, when Israel&#x2019;s evident strength brought it into line with US foreign policy, that memory of the Holocaust began to acquire the exceptional prominence it has today.<br><br> Recalling Holocaust fraudsters such as Jerzy Kosi&#x144;ski and Binjamin Wilkomirski, as well as the demagogic constructions of writers like Daniel Goldhagen, Finkelstein contends that the main danger posed to the memory of Nazism&#x2019;s victims comes from some of the very people who profess most passionately to defend it. Drawing on a wealth of untapped sources, he exposes the double shakedown of European countries and legitimate Jewish claimants, and concludes that the Holocaust industry has become an outright extortion racket.</p><p><b>Norman G. Finkelstein</b> taught political theory and the Israel&#x2013;Palestine conflict for many years. He is the author of eight books, which have been translated into more than forty foreign editions, including <i>What Gandhi Says</i>; <i>This Time We Went Too Far</i>; <i>Beyond Chutzpah</i>; and <i>Image and Reality of the Israel&#x2013;Palestine Conflict</i>.&#x201c;The most controversial book of the year.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Guardian</i><br><br> &#x201c;Finkelstein&#x2019;s downright pugilistic book delivers a wallop &#x2013; mostly because few authors have had the courage or nerve to say, as he does, that the Nazi genocide has been distorted and robbed of its true moral lessons and instead has been put to use as &#x2018;an indispensable ideological weapon.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s a provocative thesis that makes you want to reject it even as you are compelled to keep reading by the strength of his case and the bravura of his assertions.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>LA Weekly</i><br><br> &#x201c;If his indictment is a true one, it should prompt prosecutions, sackings, protest. The book shouts scandal. It is a polemic, communicated at maximum volume.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Finkelstein has raised some important and uncomfortable issues.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Jewish Quarterly</i><br><br> &#x201c;Into this minefield, through which most have trodden perhaps a little too gingerly, has bust Norman Finkelstein, a Jew and a self-professed iconoclast, heretic and enemy of the American-Jewish establishment &#x2013; and he is lobbing grenades.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Spectator</i><br><br> &#x201c;A short, sharp, and copiously noted polemic.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Times Higher Educational Supplement</i><br><br> &#x201c;Finkelstein is at his best when he skewers those who would sacralize the Holocaust.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i><br><br> &#x201c;His basic argument that the memories of the Holocaust are being debased is serious and should be give its due.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Economist</i><br><br> &#x201c;Clever, explosive, sometimes even wryly funny.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Salon</i><br><br> &#x201c;This is, in short, a lucid, provocative and passionate book. Anyone with an open mind and an interest in the subject should ignore the critical brickbats and read what Finkelstein has to say.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>New Statesman</i><br><br>&#x201c;He deserves to be heard ... he is making some profound points that many younger and more thoughtful Jews have quietly been attempting to debate, but whose voices have been stilled by the establishment, particularly in the US.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Evening Standard</i><br><br> &#x201c;Finkelstein should be credited for writing a well-researched book that can help shut down the Holocaust Industry when the public becomes aware of its dishonesty and its vulgar exploitation of Jewish suffering.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Z Magazine</i><br><br>&#x201c;The reality of the Nazi holocaust remains. Memory can still enable us to recognise new victims, extend sensitivity and monitor signs of impending genocide.

He reminds us of God&#39;s indwelling presence and that we are inherently beloved. Remembering who we truly are is a gradual, lifelong journey: Fr Richard offers insights to ease the process and lead us back to our Source. Although each life moves at its own pace and in different ways, our growth does follow a common sequence - from innocence, through inevitable brokenness, to putting ourselves back together, and, ultimately, to ripening into union with self, God, the world and others. The author explores each stage, drawing from Scripture, Christian mystics, non-dual teachers from various faiths, and wisdom from other fields such as psychology, science, the Enneagram and the Twelve Steps. He is not teaching new concepts so much as framing them in a way that resonates with our intuitive wisdom, the truth that our souls already know. Each week concludes with a unique invitation to contemplative practice. Throughout the book, Fr. Richard also calls us to compassionate action: the spiritual journey is not merely for our own transformation, but for the healing of the world.</p><p></p><h2>I Am Gandhi: A Graphic Biography of a Hero (Ordinary People Change the World)</h2><p><b>Twenty-five exceptional comic book creators join forces to share the heroic story of Gandhi in this inspiring graphic novel biography.</b><br><br>As a young man in India, Gandhi saw firsthand how people were treated unfairly.

We encounter jellyfish that release microscopic venom-packed darts known to kill humans in just two minutes, a two-inch caterpillar with toxic bristles that trigger hemorrhaging throughout the body, and a stunning blue-ringed octopus with saliva capable of inducing total paralysis. How could an animal as simple as a jellyfish evolve such an intricate, deadly poison? And how can a snake possess enzymes that tear through tissue yet leave its own body unscathed? Wilcox meets the fearless scientists who often risk their lives studying these lethal beasts to find out, and puts her life on the line to examine these species up close. Drawing on her own research on venom chemistry and evolution, she also shows how venom is helping us untangle the complex mechanisms of some of our most devastating diseases.</p><p><i>Venomous</i> reveals that the animals we fear the most actually hold the keys to a deeper understanding of evolution, adaptation, and immunity.

Taken under the wing of the hospital&#x2019;s most notable patient, Zelda Fitzgerald, Evalina witnesses cascading events that lead up to the tragic fire of 1948 that killed nine women in a locked ward, Zelda among them. Author Lee Smith has created, through a seamless blending of fiction and fact, a mesmerizing novel about a world apart--in which art and madness are luminously intertwined.</p><p><p><strong>"The insane are always mere guests on earth, eternal strangers carrying around broken decalogues that they cannot read.&#x201d; </strong><strong>&#x2014;F.

The year is 1936, and the mental hospital is under the direction of the celebrated psychiatrist Dr. Robert S. Carroll, whose innovative treatment for nervous disorders and addictions is based upon fresh air, diet, exercise, gardening, art, dance, music, theater, and therapies of the day such as rest cures, freeze wraps, and insulin shock. Talented Evalina is soon taken under the wing of the doctor&#x2019;s wife, a famous concert pianist, and eventually becomes the accompanist for all musical programs at the hospital, including the many dances and theatricals choreographed by longtime patient Zelda Fitzgerald. <br><br>Evalina&#x2019;s role gives her privileged access to the lives and secrets of other patients and staff swept into a cascading series of events leading up to the tragic fire of 1948 that killed nine women in a locked ward on the top floor.

With vivid imagination and scholarly depth, award-winning author Walter Wangerin Jr. weaves together the history of the early church with the life story of its greatest apostle--Paul. Wangerin begins to unfold Paul&#x2019;s incredible life by imagining the childhood and early family life of a boy then called "Saul." A fierce prosecutor of Christians before his conversion, Paul never lost his fiery dedication, boldness, and strong personality. After his shocking encounter with God on the road to Damascus, he applied his formidable strengths to spreading the gospel. Wangerin deftly reveals Paul&#x2019;s character through each stage of his life, and enables us to see Paul the person, living and complex, viewed through the eyes of his contemporaries: Barnabas, James, Prisca, Seneca, and Luke. Paul&#x2019;s rich interaction and brilliant dialogue with friends and foes, leaders and slaves, Jews and Greeks, creates a swift and intense historical drama around the man who spread the seed of the Gospel to the ends of the known world.</p></p><p>Saul of Tarsus, the impassioned rabbi and persecutor of Christians, had a Damascus road experience that changed his life and helped shape the future of the world. As Paul, writer of some of the meatiest chunks of the New Testament and zealous missionary to the Gentiles, he became one of the most controversial figures in history.<p> Yet what do we know about the man, other than what's in the letters that have fashioned the Christian church for 2,000 years? Unless you are a theologian or historian, the answer probably is very little--until now. Walter Wangerin, the highly acclaimed scholar and writer, has breathed new life into this fiery, enigmatic, and passionate creature in what should be celebrated as a seriously good work of literature.</p><p> The novel, which combines expert knowledge and prophetic imagination, charts the first exhilarating and dangerous years of the church after the death of Christ. It is seen through the eyes of the witnesses--Priscilla, who meets Paul in Corinth; Barnabus, Timothy, and Titus, his companions; James and Simon Peter, the "pillar" of the first Christians; and Seneca, the great Roman writer, statesman, and adviser to Nero.</p><p> Wangerin serves up a feast of color and detail that brings the first century--and, even more impressively, the Bible--alive. Whatever your religious persuasion, this book serves as a fine companion to the one of the greatest yet most puzzling stories ever told. <i>--Brian Draper, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Walter Wangerin Jr. first came to prominence as the award-winning author of The Book of the Dun Cow.

Rabbi Joseph Telushkin is as celebrated for his wit as for his scholarship, and in this immensely entertaining book, he displays both in equal measure. Stimulating, something stinging, and always very, very funny, Jewish Humor offers a classic portrait of the Jewish collective unconscious.</p></p><p><p>Joseph Telushkin is a rabbi, scholar, and bestselling author of eighteen books, among them <em>A Code of Jewish Ethics</em> and <em>Words That Hurt, Words That Heal</em>. His book <em>Jewish Literacy</em> is the widest-selling work on the topic of Judaism. He lives with his wife, Dvorah, in New York City, and lectures regularly throughout the United States.</p>Rabbi Telushkin (An Eye for an Eye, 1991), rooted in the tradition of reverence for past learning, has gathered lots of hoary jokes and aged wisecracks, together with a few more recent japes, that make Jews laugh. To coreligionists, they'll seem like old friends; to others, the gags and their elucidation may be more in the nature of revelation. Another book of ethnic gags? Hold the cry of ``gevalt!'' because Telushkin has an unstated agenda. True to his calling, he uses the funny stuff to instruct. In this collection (in which some bits are, naturally, funnier than others), everything stands for something else--but all of it carries explanations. The exegesis of the jokes becomes a little primer on a religion and a way of life mystifying to strangers and sometimes just as puzzling to nominal adherents. It's a truism that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle applies to humor--observing and analyzing it alters it. That effect can be seen here as Telushkin trots out Jackie Mason and Sigmund Freud, as well as Leo Rosten and a host of Unknown Comics for a higher purpose. The tales of the wise rabbis, the fabled fools of Chelm, the anti-Semites, the schnorrers, and the big shots all serve to illustrate his lessons. Was the shtetl a forerunner of Catskills on Broadway? Why are comedians so often Jewish? Why are Jews so often comedians? Why ask questions? Just listen to the rabbi and his jokes. Fine, funny fare for Jew and non-Jew alike. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

That was how she described it in her diary: a sorrowing sky, the days and nights washed by the grief of angels, though she didn&#x2019;t speculate on the cause of their celestial distress.<br><br> Even then, she was writing short stories in addition to keeping a diary. That rainy winter, her simple narratives were all about a dog named Jasper whose cruel master had abandoned him on a storm-swept beach south of San Francisco. In each of those little fictions, Jasper, a gray-and-black mongrel, found a new home. But at the end of every tale, his haven proved impermanent for one reason or another. Determined to keep his spirits high, good Jasper traveled southward, hundreds of miles, in search of his forever home.<br><br> Bibi was a happy child, a stranger to melancholy; therefore, it seemed odd to her then&#x2014;and for years after&#x2014;that she should write multiple woeful episodes about a lonely, beleaguered mutt whose search for love was never more than briefly fulfilled. Understanding didn&#x2019;t come to her until after her twenty-second birthday.<br><br> In one sense, everyone is a magpie. Bibi was one, but she didn&#x2019;t know it then. Much time would pass before she recognized some truths that she had hidden away in her magpie heart.<br><br> The magpie, a bird with striking pied plumage and a long tail, often hoards objects that strike it as significant: buttons, bits of string, twists of ribbon, colorful beads, fragments of broken glass. Having concealed these treasures from the world, the magpie builds a new nest the following year and forgets where its trove is located; therefore, having hidden its collection even from itself, the bird starts a new one.<br><br> People hide truths about themselves from themselves. Such self-deception is a coping mechanism, and to one extent or another, most people begin deceiving themselves when they&#x2019;re children.<br><br> That sodden winter when she was ten, Bibi lived with her parents in a small bungalow in Corona del Mar, a picturesque neighborhood of Newport Beach. Although they were just three blocks from the Pacific, they had no ocean view. The first Saturday in April, she was home alone, sitting in a rocking chair on the front porch of the quaint shingled house as warm rain streamed straight down through the palm trees and the ficuses, as it sizzled on the blacktop like hot oil on a griddle.<br><br> She was not a child who lazed around. Her mind remained always busy, spinning. She had a yellow lined tablet and a collection of pencils with which she was composing yet another installment in the saga of lonesome Jasper. Movement at the periphery of her vision caused her to look up, whereupon she discovered a soaked and weary dog ascending the sidewalk from the distant sea.<br><br> At ten, her sense of wonder had not been worn thin; and she sensed that a surprising turn of events was about to occur. In the grip of an agreeable expectation, she put down the tablet and the pencil, rose from the chair, and went to the head of the porch steps.<br><br> The dog looked nothing like the lonely mongrel in her stories. The bedraggled golden retriever halted where the bungalow walkway met the public sidewalk. Girl and beast regarded each other. She called to him, &#x201c;Here, boy, here.&#x201d; He needed to be coaxed, but eventually he approached the porch and climbed the steps. Bibi stooped to his level to peer into his eyes, which were as golden as his coat. &#x201c;You stink.&#x201d; The retriever yawned, as if his stinkiness was old news to him.<br><br> He wore a cracked and filthy leather collar. No license tag dangled from it. There wasn&#x2019;t one of those name-and-phone-number plates riveted to it, which a responsible owner should have provided.<br><br> Bibi led the dog off the porch, through the rain, around the side of the house, into a brick-paved thirty-foot-square courtyard flanked by stuccoed privacy walls along the property lines to the east and west. To the south stood a two-car garage that opened onto an alleyway. Exterior steps rose to a small balcony and an apartment above the garage. Bibi avoided glancing up at those windows.<br><br> She told the retriever to wait on the back porch while she went into the house. He surprised her by being there when she returned with two beach towels, shampoo, a hair dryer, and a hairbrush. He ran with her across the courtyard, out of the rain and into the garage.<br><br> After she turned on the lights, after she took the stained and mud-crusted collar from around his neck, she saw something that she had not previously noticed. She considered dropping the collar in the garbage can, burying it under other trash, but she knew that would be wrong. Instead, she opened a drawer in the cabinet beside her father&#x2019;s workbench, took one of several chamois cloths from his supply, and wrapped the collar in it.<br><br> A sound issued from the apartment overhead, a brief hard clatter. Startled, Bibi looked at the garage ceiling, where the open four-by-six joists were festooned with spider architecture.<br><br> She thought she heard a low and anguished voice, too. After listening intently for half a minute, she told herself that she must have imagined it.<br><br> Between two of the joists, backlit by a bare dust-coated bulb in a white ceramic socket, a fat spider danced from string to string, plucking from its silken harp a music beyond human hearing.<br><br> Bibi thought of Charlotte the spider, who saved Wilbur the pig, her friend, in E. B. White&#x2019;s book Charlotte&#x2019;s Web. For a moment, Bibi was all but unaware of the garage as an image rose in her mind and became more real to her than reality:<br><br> Hundreds of tiny young spiders, Charlotte&#x2019;s offspring fresh from her egg sac many weeks after her sad death, standing on their heads and pointing their spinnerets at the sky, letting loose small clouds of fine silk.

She rearranged the volumes to create a hollow into which she inserted the chamois-wrapped collar before returning the box to the closet.<br><br> &#x201c;Your name is Olaf,&#x201d; she informed the retriever, and he reacted to this christening by wagging his tail. &#x201c;Olaf. Someday, I&#x2019;ll tell you why.&#x201d;<br><br> In time, Bibi forgot about the collar because she wanted to forget.

For constitutionalists, regulation of hate speech violates the First Amendment and damages a free society. Against this absolutist view, Jeremy Waldron argues powerfully that hate speech should be regulated as part of our commitment to human dignity and to inclusion and respect for members of vulnerable minorities.</p><p>Causing offense&#x2015;by depicting a religious leader as a terrorist in a newspaper cartoon, for example&#x2015;is not the same as launching a libelous attack on a group&#x2019;s dignity, according to Waldron, and it lies outside the reach of law. But defamation of a minority group, through hate speech, undermines a public good that can and should be protected: the basic assurance of inclusion in society for all members. A social environment polluted by anti-gay leaflets, Nazi banners, and burning crosses sends an implicit message to the targets of such hatred: your security is uncertain and you can expect to face humiliation and discrimination when you leave your home.</p><p>Free-speech advocates boast of despising what racists say but defending to the death their right to say it. Waldron finds this emphasis on intellectual resilience misguided and points instead to the threat hate speech poses to the lives, dignity, and reputations of minority members. Finding support for his view among philosophers of the Enlightenment, Waldron asks us to move beyond knee-jerk American exceptionalism in our debates over the serious consequences of hateful speech.</p></p><p>Jeremy Waldron is University Professor in the School of Law at New York University.&#x201c;A powerful little book that seeks to dismantle familiar defenses of the right to indefensible speech.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kelefa Sanneh</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Yorker</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Waldron&#x2019;s] book sheds light on a number of difficult issues, and occasionally exposes the difference between historical fact and fiction... He elegantly and convincingly advocates that our leaders should not only avoid the use of hate speech themselves, but also condemn its use by others... We should all do our best to preserve President Ford&#x2019;s conception of America as a place where we can disagree without being disagreeable. An understanding of the arguments in Waldron&#x2019;s book may help us to do so.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Paul Stevens</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Waldron...challenges society and its legal system to do something about [the harm done by hate speech]. But the likelihood that something will be done is slim if Waldron is right about the state of First Amendment discourse: &#x2018;[I]n the American debate, the philosophical arguments about hate speech are knee-jerk, impulsive and thoughtless.&#x2019; Not the arguments of this book, however; they hit the mark every time.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stanley Fish</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Harm in Hate Speech</i> is the fullest embodiment of arguments that Waldron has been developing for years... Waldron&#x2019;s treatise is primarily a philosophical defense of hate-speech regulation. He argues that hate speech is an &#x2018;environmental&#x2019; problem that pollutes the atmosphere of security and dignity that society should provide to all its members... Speech intended to intimidate or malign destroys this assurance... While we should continue to protect the free speech of those we disagree with, <i>The Harm in Hate Speech</i> makes a compelling case that they are not the only ones who need defending.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Daniel Townshend</b><b>, </b><b><i>American Prospect</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Waldron is firmly on the side of the hate speech legislators. He wants free speech dogmatists to think again, and presents a series of challenges to the prevailing view in the U.S.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Nigel Warburton</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;To the (mostly white) liberals who say they hate the content of hate speech, but defend its right to exist under the First Amendment (often while patting themselves on the back for their tolerance), Waldron replies, in essence: easy for you to say. In this brief, eloquent book, he urges readers (at a bare minimum) to think about how hate speech feels from the point of view of its targets... From key court battles Waldron teases out the ideas that matter in deciding how to balance free expression with a free society, one in which everybody can &#x2018;know that when they leave home in the morning, they can count on not being discriminated against or humiliated or terrorized.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kate Tuttle</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a wonderful book. It conveys complex ideas in an accessible and convincing way... Jeremy Waldron has put together a clear and compelling rationale for hate-speech laws&#x2015;the harm that it causes to human dignity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Katharine Gelber</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This book develops a theory of hate speech that challenges existing U.S. legal rubrics. U.S. courts have repeatedly held that the First Amendment forbids criminalization of hate speech, but Waldron advances a broader view of the link between free expression and important social values such as tolerance and inclusiveness... If dignity is a concept that is valued by a polity, Waldron argues, then there are important reasons to distinguish hate speech from other forms of expression that merit legal protection. An elegant synthesis of modern legal philosophy and leading cases, as well as a critique of the positions of prominent legal theorists such as Ronald Dworkin and C. Edwin Baker, the book is a readable, thought-provoking contribution to the literature.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>S. B. Lichtman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A vigorously argued, intelligent challenge to the &#x2018;liberal bravado&#x2019; of U.S. First Amendment scholars. In an eloquent reply to free-speech advocates, Waldron moves step by step in building the argument as to why hate-speech laws are good for a well-ordered society... The author argues that the damage caused by hate speech is like an &#x2018;environmental threat to social peace, a sort of slow-acting poison&#x2019; that robs the intended victims of their dignity and reputation in society. Waldron&#x2019;s analogy between hate speech and pornography&#x2015;in terms of the defamation of women&#x2015;is particularly noteworthy. He responds carefully to the notion of free speech as a necessary part of democracy&#x2019;s &#x2018;marketplace of ideas&#x2019; and looks to the Enlightenment philosophes for their views on toleration and defamation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Waldron is a legal and political thinker at the height of his powers.

One comes out incredibly successful, and the other fails. What makes the difference? That&#39;s the question bestselling author Robert G. Allen kept asking himself. He had spent most of his life writing finance books and teaching courses for hundreds of thousands of students. He noticed that certain students would put his systems to work with incredible results, while others would stumble, become overwhelmed, and stop working towards their goals. If the students were the same, and the information was the same, what was the problem? The problem was the follow-thru. We all want to follow-thru--to reach our goals, to earn more, to have closer relationships, better health, and more time freedom. But our lives are full of distractions. It&#39;s easy to lose sight of what we really want. Even the most powerful course or book only stays with us for a few days. Most people fail to change long-term because they don&#39;t create habits to reinforce what&#39;s truly important. What&#39;s needed is a simple daily system to help us stay on target. Welcome to The Four Maps. A powerful meditation on successful living combined with a visual framework for personal development, The Four Maps of Happy Successful People is a landmark book, designed to help you find your purpose, get unstuck, and reach your ideal lifestyle.

In the book, veteran journalist J.C. Herz explains the science of maximum effort, why the modern gym fails an obese society, and the&nbsp;psychic&nbsp;rewards&nbsp;of ending up on the floor feeling as though you're about to die.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The story traces CrossFit&#x2019;s rise, from a single underground gym in Santa Cruz to its adoption as the workout of choice for elite special forces, firefighters and cops, to its popularity as the go-to fitness routine for regular Joes and Janes. Especially riveting is Herz&#x2019;s description of The CrossFit Games, which begin as an informal throw-down on a California ranch and evolve into a televised global proving ground for the fittest men and women on Earth,&nbsp;as well as hundreds of thousands of lesser mortals.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In her portrayal of the sport's star athletes, its passionate coaches and its&nbsp;&#x201c;chief armorer,&#x201d; Rogue Fitness, Herz powerfully evokes the uniqueness of a fitness culture that cultivates primal fierceness in average&nbsp;people.&nbsp;And in the shared ordeal of an all-consuming workout, she unearths the ritual intensity that's been with us since humans invented sports, showing us how, on a deep level, we're all tribal hunters and first responders, waiting for the signal to go all-out.&nbsp;</p></p><p>J.C. Herz is a Harvard-educated former <i>New York Times</i> columnist as well as a former rock critic and tech writer for <i>Rolling Stone </i>and <i>Wired. </i>A two-time author and technology entrepreneur, she&nbsp;started doing CrossFit in a gym where white-collar professionals and new moms cranked through pull-ups and Olympic lifts next to active duty military and members of the presidential Secret Service detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her favorite CrossFit workout is &#x201c;Cindy.&#x201d;Chapter 9<br><br> &nbsp;<br> THE BLUE ROOM<br> &nbsp;<br> Martial Arts Sublets and the Forbidden<br> Pleasure of Dropping Barbells<br> &nbsp;<br> With a few barbells, medicine balls, pull-up bars, boxes, and kettle bells, and a nominal fee to CrossFit HQ , any certified Cross- Fit coach could become the proprietor of a CrossFit affiliate. In the economic hangover from the dot-com crash, this meant guys like Jerry Hill could sublet space, often from martial arts dojos, before they had enough athletes to afford a dedicated space. From Glassman&#x2019;s early years in Santa Cruz to today, there&#x2019;s been a symbiosis between CrossFit and martial arts, especially jujitsu, mixed martial arts, and Krav Maga. Part of this compatability is cultural, and part of it is architectural. The cultural part is a fundamental embrace of functional fitness. In martial arts, it doesn&#x2019;t matter how beautifully curved your biceps are, or if you have six-pack abs. If you can&#x2019;t hit hard, or if you&#x2019;re easily winded, someone&#x2019;s going to mess you up. Any kind of conditioning that makes you hit harder or breathe better in the middle of a round makes it less likely you&#x2019;ll get messed up. So people who do hard-core-combat martial arts (as opposed to the beauty-of-grace-and-form varieties) are serious about high-intensity training.<br> &nbsp;<br> The time domain of a martial arts match, a single-digit&nbsp; number of minutes of all-out&nbsp; effort, is on the same order as a WOD. The type of effort required&#x2014;violent bursts of explosive effort under fatigue and<br> time pressure&#x2014;is exactly what CrossFit cultivates. It&#x2019;s competitive, high discipline, heavily male (along with a certain type of seriously kick-ass female). It demands the ability to suffer, and develops an athlete&#x2019;s capacity to suffer and keep going&#x2014;the quality of relentlessness.<br> &nbsp;<br> CrossFit, in its early days, attracted MMA fighters with a geek streak. Guys like Josh Newman, who went to Yale, built and sold tech companies, and spent time getting his teeth knocked loose in Connecticut MMA arenas, invariably stumbled onto the CrossFit website and caught the bug. After winning&nbsp; the state MMA championship in his weight class two years in a row, Newman was looking for an edge. As he says, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing like getting the crap beat out of you to keep you honest at the gym.&#x201d;1<br> &nbsp;<br> When he checked out the CrossFit.com site, Josh thought the Workout of the Day was a joke: 400 meters of walking lunges. Then he tried it and, about 100 meters in, realized, &#x201c;Oh yeah&#x2014;I&#x2019;m fucked.&#x201d; The next day, he missed his stop on the subway because he literally could not stand up. He had to wait until the next stop, when a lady near the pole got off, so he could slide across the subway bench, grab the pole, pull himself to a standing position, and hobble onto the platform. If some- thing so simple and time efficient could incapacitate him, he thought, this was clearly the way to go.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before long, he&#x2019;d roped in a buddy who did Brazilian jujitsu (and later founded CrossFit Virtuosity in Brooklyn) to work out in Central Park. They showed up with medicine balls and kettle bells and did pull-ups on the playgrounds. People joined, and pretty soon ten of them were getting in trouble with the park police for doing box jumps on benches or stringing gymnastics rings up on the trees. This went on for six months, until it got cold. Then they moved into, and got kicked out of, six gyms in the space of two years. Because they did things like rig treadmills to see how fast they could run without shooting off the back. Or bang out so many pull-ups in a personal training gym that clients would simply abandon the hard body trainers who&#x2019;d brought them there to Feel the Burn and maybe move the peg down one notch on the machine. At a Chinatown kickboxing gym, the manager saw Josh and his pals doing high-volume barbell WODs, marched over, and barked, &#x201c;What you guys are doing looks really dangerous.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Ten feet away guys were punching each other in the face, which was, apparently, not really dangerous.<br> The absurdity, and the hassle of it all, was just too much. So in 2007, Newman&nbsp; rented a 1,000-square-foot&nbsp; place in the Garment&nbsp; District, &#x201c;The Black Box,&#x201d; which refers to CrossFit&#x2019;s empirical discipline of measuring inputs (the workouts)&nbsp; and outputs (athletic&nbsp; performance)&nbsp; from the training method. In a lovely stroke of irony, the term is also drama- world jargon for a small, bare-bones experimental theater.<br> Newman needed thirty&nbsp; members to cover&nbsp; the&nbsp; rent,&nbsp; and&nbsp; he had twenty people. &#x201c;There are not thirty people in New York City who are going to do this CrossFit thing,&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;This is just going to be an expensive gym membership for me.&#x201d; That year, the Black Box grew from thirty members to over a hundred. Newman got kicked out of his first Garment District space when, during a WOD, a barbell someone dropped from overhead crashed straight through the floor into the space below. It was after hours, but the landlord wasn&#x2019;t so thrilled. When the Black Box decamped to a larger space, also in the Garment District, Newman and his people pulled up the mats to move. They had broken literally every tile.<br> &nbsp;<br> The tiles were broken because CrossFitters, left to their own devices, regularly dump heavily loaded barbells from overhead onto the ground. There is a legitimate reason for this: safety. If an athlete is going for maximum effort with a load he&#x2019;s not sure he can propel all the way up to his shoulders, or all the way overhead, it&#x2019;s essential that he be able to fail safely. And failing safely on a one-rep-max Olympic lift or overhead squat means dropping the bar. Also, it&#x2019;s fun to drop barbells. The ability to instantly jettison a serious amount of weight gives strength workouts the quality of play, no matter how strenuous the effort. If you can&#x2019;t do the lift, you can eject. And if you do manage to launch a heavily loaded barbell over your head, and your heart is pounding with the hot-damn-I-did-it victory beat of a personal record, it is sublime to simply release your fingers from the bar and have all those bumper plates suddenly not compress your body. The spine springs back to its full length. Muscles no longer brace. There, I did it&#x2014;I&#x2019;m free. That sense of victory and freedom, the sudden lightness of releasing a heavy burden, is like getting a cast taken off. It&#x2019;s like getting a cast taken off your soul.<br> &nbsp;<br> When it&#x2019;s synchronized, the ritual of dropping barbells is even more intense and satisfying. So for instance, in an every-minute-on-the-minute set of heavy snatches, every sixty seconds a clock ticks down, and your coach bellows, &#x201c;Three, two, one, GO!&#x201d; The lightning of electrical impulse courses through each athlete&#x2019;s nerves and muscles at the same moment. Every barbell flies toward the ceiling. There&#x2019;s a slight variation in speed, depending on each athlete&#x2019;s height and strength. Then, within a few seconds, all the barbells come crashing down, and the boom of dozens of twenty-five- and forty-five-pound rubber bumper plates hitting the ground is like war drums. Thunder. It&#x2019;s beautiful. This is why every tile in the Black Box was broken. It&#x2019;s also why CrossFit boxes outside industrial areas tend to have unhappy neighbors and grouchy landlords.<br> &nbsp;<br> So Josh Newman was sent packing by his first Garment District landlord. He was also nearly arrested in Times Square for sprinting up<br> 41st Street wearing a weight vest&#x2014;the kind of vest that&#x2019;s black nylon, with rows and rows of tiny pockets to hold one-pound lozenge-shaped weights,&nbsp; and looks exactly&nbsp; like a suicide bomber vest. Seconds into his full-speed dash into Times Square, Newman was being shouted down by ten police officers, two of them with guns drawn. &#x201c;But then,&#x201d; he recalls, &#x201c;they realized I was too small and Jewy looking to be a threat. They just said, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re doing, but never do it here again.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> Around the same time, a police car on Eisenhower Avenue in Alexandria, Virginia, slowed to a stop, its red-and-blue lights flashing in the pre-dawn darkness. Jerry Hill lowered his wheelbarrow and raised his hands. The wheelbarrow was loaded with two hundred-pound dumb- bells and an engine block, and he&#x2019;d been sprinting with it, to build grip strength, on his way to the jujitsu studio where he trained athletes. Grip strength is essential when you&#x2019;re moving a lot of weight with a barbell, or stringing together dozens of pull-ups, and the best way to build grip strength for these activities is by holding on to something heavy for as long as possible, preferably while you&#x2019;re also winded. Hence the wheel- barrow, the dumbbells, and the engine block.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a strength coach,&#x201d; Jerry projected his voice to the police car. &#x201c;These are weights.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s strength. And conditioning.&#x201d;&nbsp; The lights kept flashing. The cop got out of his car. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a strength coach,&#x201d; Jerry repeated with conviction. &#x201c;These are weights. It&#x2019;s strength. And. Conditioning.&#x201d; The cop scrutinized him, calculating the odds that this wiry little white guy was telling the truth versus running down Eisenhower Avenue with a stolen engine block in a wheelbarrow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You look suspicious,&#x201d; the cop growled, got back in his car, and drove away.<br> Jerry and his wheelbarrow trundled off to the dojo. Same as in Philly, here was a jujitsu gym whose owner was happy to earn some extra cash by time-sharing a facility with CrossFitters. Aside from the cultural kin- ship between CrossFit and martial&nbsp; arts, they have similar real estate requirements. Both disciplines tend to occupy marginal space, often industrial space: warehouses, converted light-manufacturing buildings, former auto body workshops. Space needs to be cheap, open to accom- modate sparring, and easy to equip with basic training apparatus: mats, weights, punching bags, maybe a drinking fountain. Adding some kettle bells and medicine balls doesn&#x2019;t screw up this kind of floor plan.<br> More important, the diurnal rhythms of martial arts and CrossFit were, at least initially, a perfect counterpoint. Martial arts athletes tend to work out in the evening. CrossFit&#x2019;s early adherents were morning people, rising before dawn to hit an o&#x2019;dark thirty WOD. Jerry&#x2019;s classes started at 5:15 a.m. and ran every forty-five minutes through 8:15 a.m. Then it would be time for him to go home and be Mr. Mom. But for three hours in the morning, he was king of the Blue Room, so named for the color of the jujitsu mats. &#x201c;It was on the second floor,&#x201d; he remembers. &#x201c;Everyone was asleep. It was like a speakeasy.&#x201d;2 It wasn&#x2019;t&nbsp; ideal. Because the jujitsu studio was, in turn,&nbsp; subletting<br> space from a conventional gym downstairs, there were constraints on how Jerry&#x2019;s gang could use the equipment. There weren&#x2019;t fixed pull-up bars, only bars hung on chains from the ceiling. So people learned how to time the kipping motion of their hips, generating momentum in tandem with the pendulum swing of the bar, to get up and over. There was a knack to it, as with any acrobatic trick.<br> There weren&#x2019;t boxes to jump on, so they stacked mats to 24 or 30 inches, to jump on. Shoes weren&#x2019;t allowed on the mats, so when it was time to run outside, people had to quickly lace up their shoes, run down- stairs, do their sprints, then run upstairs and kick off their shoes for the next WOD.<br> Worst of all, they couldn&#x2019;t drop weights on the floor, which meant that heavy Olympic lifting WODs were out. For a powerlifter like Jerry, this made every barbell WOD into an unconsummated love affair. Bars would be loaded with less weight than he knew his athletes could handle with their mightiest one-time efforts. They&#x2019;d string together barbell movements from the floor to hips, from hips to shoulders to overhead, and then, in a controlled sequence, back down to the ground. They never got to throw their whole selves into one skilled and mighty pull from the ground.<br> &nbsp;<br> But there are different ways to build strength, and the early core of Hill&#x2019;s CrossFit Oldtown gang built their strength with pull-ups, push- ups, and tons and tons of air squats. They did muscle-ups on gymnastic rings. Dan Wilson had trained with Greg Glassman in Santa Cruz and with the Marines in Pendleton, but he got his first muscle-up in the Blue Room. &#x201c;Get up there and fight it, Dan,&#x201d; Jerry hollered as Wilson swung from a pull-up to the transition. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re there, brother!!!&#x201d; From the top of the rings, Wilson, graying, buzz-cut, whooped for joy. &#x201c;Was that good? &#x201d; he asked.<br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Jerry laughed, &#x201c;that was awesome.&#x201d; They got it on video. It&#x2019;s one of the best middle-aged &#x201c;still got it, baby&#x201d; moments ever recorded.3<br> &nbsp;<br> The Blue Room gang did a lot of air-sucking metabolic conditioning, or metcons, alternating&nbsp; strength&nbsp; efforts with&nbsp; the cardio stress of box jumps, wall balls, or sprints in the stifling humidity of northern Virginia. Before long, men&#x2019;s shirts were off, and the habit of ripping shirts off during a WOD was well ingrained.<br> &nbsp;<br> A statistician named Harold Doran was the chief instigator&nbsp; of the shirt-taker-offers. Perhaps it was the heat and sweat, or the high intensity, or a touch of OCD, but when Jerry yelled &#x201c;Three, two, one, GO!&#x201d; to kick off a heavy metcon, Harold&#x2019;s shirt had only moments to serve its intended purpose before it was jettisoned to the floor. It became an inside joke that leavened the heaving intensity of summer WODs. Harold had a way of making deadpan remarks about his shirt removal that made it okay for everyone else to laugh&#x2014;he deftly controlled the joke. He began to spin a thread of self-deprecating humor that pervades CrossFit Oldtown to this day&#x2014;a mixture of absolute seriousness about physical effort and mock seriousness about yourself. It&#x2019;s the sensibility of absolute commitment to a fast 800-meter sprint or a set of unbroken pull-ups, then making yourself ridiculous with a put-on remark. Yeah, I&#x2019;m a serious athlete, check out these abs.<br> &nbsp;<br> After his morning stint as class clown, Harold would hit the showers, change into a suit, and drive north over the bridge into Georgetown as an absolutely different, stone-faced, stressful grown-up.&nbsp; He&#x2019;s a psy- chometrician, which means he analyzes student test data: all the stan- dardized tests that Congress mandated in No Child Left Behind, that teachers complain about, that teachers&#x2019; unions scream should never be used in teacher evaluations. State commissioners of education pay guys like Harold to churn those data into statistical&nbsp; results that show em- barrassing long-term differences between great teachers and the ones who stunt students&#x2019; learning for years. These statistics invariably trigger political attacks, from local school boards all the way up to Capitol Hill. Managing these projects and their blowback is all serious, all the time.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When I go into the office,&#x201d; Harold says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m swamped. Swamped. There are real grown-up issues. They&#x2019;re complicated. They&#x2019;re stressful. They&#x2019;re hard, and they&#x2019;re taxing.&nbsp; But guess what? CrossFit is every- thing that my real world is not. I get to walk into the gym, and I get to be silly and crack jokes and be friendly and not be stressed out. I don&#x2019;t think about work when I&#x2019;m in the middle of &#x2018;Fran.&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t think about a client deliverable when I...</p><h2>Netter&#39;s Clinical Anatomy (Netter Basic Science)</h2><p><p>Focus on the clinically relevant aspects of anatomy and bridge normal anatomy to common clinical conditions with <i>Netter's Clinical Anatomy, 4th Edition</i>.

Shaw's tongue-twisting rhymes, which here chronicle five sheep's attempt to eat at a tearoom, are as simply clever as ever. From the start, it's clear that this crew is out of its element. After feline waiters bring them menus, the sheep "point to words that they can't read." When "Waiters bring them spinach custard," the sheep "add sugar, salt, and mustard." Things go downhill quickly--and riotously--after the diners put pepper on their cake and begin sneezing wildly, upsetting tables and sending cups and dishes crashing to the floor. Asked to leave the premises, "Sheep pout. Sheep walk out. Suddenly they look about." The faces on Apple's wonderfully expressive creatures suddenly light up, for what they see is a lush lawn, which seems a perfect lunchtime munch.

His music, at once a source of transcendent beauty and coruscating noise, violated all definitions of genre while speaking to millions of fans and inspiring generations of musicians.<br><br>But while his iconic status may be fixed, the man himself was anything but. Lou Reed's life was a transformer's odyssey. Eternally restless and endlessly hungry for new experiences, Reed reinvented his persona, his sound, even his sexuality time and again. A man of contradictions and extremes, he was fiercely independent yet afraid of being alone, artistically fearless yet deeply paranoid, eager for commercial success yet disdainful of his own triumphs. Channeling his jagged energy and literary sensibility into classic songs - like "Walk on the Wild Side" and "Sweet Jane" - and radically experimental albums alike, Reed remained desperately true to his artistic vision, wherever it led him. <br><br>Now, just a few years after Reed's death, <i>Rolling Stone</i> writer Anthony DeCurtis, who knew Reed and interviewed him extensively, tells the provocative story of his complex and chameleonic life. With unparalleled access to dozens of Reed's friends, family, and collaborators, DeCurtis tracks Reed's five-decade career through the accounts of those who knew him and through Reed's most revealing testimony, his music. We travel deep into his defiantly subterranean world, enter the studio as the Velvet Underground record their groundbreaking work, and revel in Reed's relationships with such legendary figures as Andy Warhol, David Bowie, and Laurie Anderson. Gritty, intimate, and unflinching, <i>Lou Reed</i> is an illuminating tribute to one of the most incendiary artists of our time.</p><p><b>Anthony DeCurtis </b>is a contributing editor for <i>Rolling Stone,</i> where his work has appeared for more than thirty-five years, and a distinguished lecturer in the creative writing program at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of<i> In Other Words </i>and<i> Rocking My Life Away </i>and<i> </i>the cowriter of<i> </i>Clive<i> </i>Davis's autobiography,<i> The Soundtrack of My Life, </i>a <i>New York Times </i>bestseller<i>. </i>DeCurtis is a Grammy Award winner and has served as a member of the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame nominating committee for twenty-five years.<i> </i>He holds a PhD in American literature and lives in New York City."If the goal of a biography is to bring its subject back to life, <i>Lou Reed</i>, DeCurtis's sympathetic but never fawning book, succeeds...<b>Carefully researched and thoughtfully written, <i>Lou Reed</i> is the best Reed biography to date</b>."<b></b>&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></i></b><br><br>"DeCurtis has given us a thorough and vivid portrait of an artist who, he shows us, was even darker than we knew."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>The</i> <i>New York Review of Books</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Anthony DeCurtis was one of the few music critics Lou Reed read and whose company he enjoyed.

I highly recommend it."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Suzanne Vega</b></i></b><br><br>"When most people think of Lou Reed, they picture the black, rotting heart of rock and roll, full of dissonance, decadence and decay. But <b>as Anthony DeCurtis makes clear in his new book, behind the image and the rumors, Lou was one thing: a writer, a man who spent his life telling the absolute, painful truth in his songs - </b>the truth about himself, the scenes he observed, and the world at large. His words were so powerful that the Velvet Underground had to invent a new musical language to match them. I'm not the first musician to pledge allegiance to Lou and the Velvets, and I won't be the last. <b>Read this book, and explore the f*cking genius that was Lou Reed</b>."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Peter Buck, co-founder and lead guitarist of R.E.M.</b></i></b><br><br>"<b>Anthony DeCurtis captures the soul and the essence of Lou Reed in his terrific new biography</b> of the brilliant, culture-shaping musician.

The word Shango is the name of a historical figure who was the fourth Alafin (Community Chief) of Oyo. The name has also been given to a complex convergence of Spiritual Forces that are key elements in the Ifa concept of courage and justice. These Spiritual Forces form the essence of Shango s role in the Spiritual Realm and are at the foundation of the process of spiritual transformation. It is lightning that reaches from the Realm of the Ancestors to Earth as a reminder of the humbling power that exists within Nature itself. Lightning is the Ifa symbol for Divine Justice.</p><p>Awo Baba Falokun Fatunmbi is a white North American, who at the age of 38 visited Nigeria with the purpose of studying the Yoruba traditions Ifa Orisa.

Today you make your trade&#x2014;everything you have accomplished and become for whatever God offers in exchange. There you are, poised on the brink, lifetime in hand, ready to step into eternity.<br>&nbsp;<br>What a moment! And what an amazing exchange! Your blink in the sun for God's endless day. Your spoonful of water for His Amazon River.<br>&nbsp;<br>You take your step. You put down your little handful of time and pick up your forever life.... <br>&nbsp;<br>But what if I told you that the small choices you make today&#x2014;like how you interact with your boss, or whom you invite to dinner&#x2014;could change what happens next?<br>&nbsp;<br>Would you be surprised?<br>&nbsp;<br>In the little book you're holding, you're going to discover that Jesus revealed that our actions now will affect our future forever. Astoundingly, millions who follow Jesus seem to have missed what He said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Could you be one?<br>&nbsp;<br>I was. I grew up in a family that attended church regularly, and I was taught the Bible from the time I was young. Later I spent nine years pursuing theological training. But the clear teachings of Jesus on this subject remained lost to me, like overlooked treasures in my own house. When I finally discovered them, many things started to make sense for the first time.<br>&nbsp;<br>Let's admit it: Any change in how we think about our future, even if it could radically improve our prospects, takes courage. We struggle to let go of comfortable assumptions, even when they're preventing us from seeing the whole truth. We're like toddlers peering<br>through a keyhole at the night sky, trying to hold on to our tiny patch of stars.<br>&nbsp;<br>But the keyhole is so small and the view is so great. Jesus wants to open the door and show us more. <br>&nbsp;<br>Much more.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>PREPARE TO BE ASTONISHED</b><br>No one made more shocking statements about the afterlife than Jesus of Nazareth. His teachings often left His audiences amazed, dumbfounded, even outraged. Take His first public appearance at the age of twelve: "All who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers" (Luke 2:47).<br>&nbsp;<br>When Jesus formally began His ministry, His audience was again "astonished" (Matthew 7:28). In His teaching known as the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said:<br>&nbsp;<br>"Blessed are you when men hate you,<br>And when they exclude you,<br>And revile you, and cast out your name as evil,<br>For the Son of Man's sake.<br>Rejoice in that day and leap for joy!"<br>LUKE 6:22-23<br>&nbsp;<br>You might know these verses well. I have to confess that I read them dozens, if not scores, of times before I really read them. Jesus' statement seems incredible, doesn't it? I used to think He was saying something like, "If you are persecuted on My behalf, you'll be so happy that you'll jump for sheer delight."<br>&nbsp;<br>But if you read on, it's clear that that's not what Jesus meant. He continued:<br>&nbsp;<br>"For indeed your reward is great in heaven."<br>V. 23<br>&nbsp;<br>In those eight words, Jesus reveals why you and I can rejoice, even in the worst circumstances. Why? Because there is a direct connection between something you do for Him on earth and something "great" He will do for you in heaven.<br>&nbsp;<br>Notice that Jesus describes it as a reward for doing, which would distinguish it, for example, from a gift you receive for believing. Also, the reward is specifically and personally yours if you behave in one way, but is not yours if you behave in another (for example, if you ran away under the pressure of persecution).<br>&nbsp;<br>You see, Jesus isn't asking you and me to enjoy misery on His behalf. Instead He's saying that the consequences in heaven for certain actions on earth will be so wonderful that simply knowing they're coming&#x2014;and knowing that they will be great&#x2014;can transform how we live now. Yes, and even create spontaneous outbursts of joy!<br>&nbsp;<br>This promise of reward in heaven isn't an isolated example of Jesus' teachings on the subject: <br>&nbsp;<br>� "He will reward each according to his works"<br>(Matthew 16:27).<br>&nbsp;<br>� "You will have treasure in heaven" (Matthew<br>19:21).<br>&nbsp;<br>� "You will be blessed...for you shall be repaid at the resurrection" (Luke 14:14).<br>&nbsp;<br>As you're about to discover, the implications of these passages are enormous. For one thing, they suggest that God is keeping track of what you do for Him every day.<br>For another, that you have more to gain by serving Him than you ever imagined.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>TRACKING DOWN THE PROMISE</b><br>Let me tell you how I came to write this book. In 1985 when I first stumbled upon Jesus' teachings on reward in heaven, I was startled. What He was saying seemed to contradict much of what I had always been taught and believed.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I began an intensive search for the truth, starting with every Bible verse on the subject of eternal rewards. I studied theological and scholarly works. I spent hours thinking about what Jesus seemed to be saying with such urgency. And I became convinced that spiritual seekers around the world, including millions of Jesus' followers, had mislaid a truth of great importance and promise&#x2014;and it was time to get it back.<br>&nbsp;<br>Five years of in-depth study and twelve thick binders later, my findings lined the shelves of my study.<br>&nbsp;<br>One day I got a call from Dr. Earl Radmacher, president of Western Seminary in Oregon, inviting me to present my material in a weeklong graduate course at the seminary. I agreed, but only after he promised to assemble a panel of leading scholars, including some who had also been studying rewards, to sit in and evaluate every word.<br>&nbsp;<br>On an April morning several months later, I walked across the seminary campus, lugging my teaching materials. I arrived at the lecture room, which was filled with some of the brightest individuals I had ever met: department chairpersons of the Greek and Hebrew languages, church historians, Bible teachers, seminarians, and pastors from a range of denominations.<br>&nbsp;<br>I taught every morning for four hours. Each afternoon, a special group of scholars met at<br>Dr. Radmacher's home and debated every point.<br>&nbsp;<br>One day a church historian from Romania assured us that what we were studying was not new theology; it had been part of Christian beliefs and teaching from the first century on. To make his point he asked us, "What do the greats of church history such as Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Wesley, and Spurgeon all have in common?"<br>&nbsp;<br>When everyone hesitated, he told us his answer: "They all earnestly believed in and hoped for eternal rewards."<br>&nbsp;<br>Toward the end of the week, I noticed a shift. The roomful of scholars was spending less time debating and more time responding personally to the material. One afternoon an older participant pulled me aside. "I thought God brought me here to learn more about eternal rewards," he said, "but I was wrong. He brought me here to change my heart&#x2014;I'm leaving a changed professor!"<br>&nbsp;<br>On the last day, I asked the group, "Are you convinced that what I've been teaching about rewards is consistent with what Jesus taught?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"We're convinced," they replied. And I have never looked back.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>THE TWO KEYS</b><br>In the pages ahead, you'll encounter for yourself the findings we explored that week at Western Seminary. Whether you're familiar with Jesus' teachings about eternal rewards or you're coming upon them for the first time, encourage you to read with great expectation. Important spiritual breakthroughs await you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Starting with statements Jesus made, we'll carefully construct the biggest, truest view possible of your entire life. We'll be using a lot of familiar words&#x2014;words like heaven, treasure, works, and faith. I urge you to be patient as we look beneath these familiar labels for hidden insights.<br>&nbsp;<br>The teachings of Jesus show us that there are two keys that determine everything about your eternity.<br>&nbsp;<br>The first key is your belief. This key unlocks the door to eternal life and determines where you will spend eternity.<br>&nbsp;<br>The second key is your behavior. It unlocks the door to reward and determines how you will spend eternity.<br>&nbsp;<br>This second key is the focus of A Life God Rewards. Although the role of behavior (we'll also use words like actions or works) isn't more important to your future than belief, it has been more overlooked in recent times. And the promise of rediscovering the truths it unlocks is enormous, especially for followers of Jesus.<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, by the time you're done reading, you'll approach daily life in a dramatically different way. Simple decisions, such as how you spend your time and money, will become opportunities of great promise. And you will begin to live with an unshakable certainty that everything you do today matters forever.<br>&nbsp;<br>RUMORS OF BLUE WHALES<br>In the first book in this series, The Prayer of Jabez, we learned that God wants us to ask for His blessing and for greater influence, or "territory," in this world. The next book, Secrets of the Vine, showed that Jesus wants our territory to produce a great harvest of good works for Him.<br>&nbsp;<br>In A Life God Rewards, I want to show you how the harvest you produce will directly impact your experience in eternity&#x2014;and how that truth can change your life today for the better.<br>&nbsp;<br>I'll admit that on a subject like eternity, we must proceed thoughtfully and humbly. We're like tadpoles swapping stories of blue whales. We're like one twin in the womb trying to convince his brother that it's only a matter of time before they're both breathing air and riding tricycles.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fortunately for all of us, God sent His Son from heaven to help us see the whole truth. If you and I are willing to be surprised, unsettled, even shocked by His words, our prospects for living a life He rewards will change for the better, starting now.</p><h2>MS.

Until Sunday. Then, all the world&#39;s children are invited to come together and share in the meal. Celebrated artist Eric Carle brings new energy to these much-loved verses as lively animals parade across the page, munching on favorite dishes, and introducing young readers to the names of the days of the week. Both art and song invite children to join in the procession and sing along.</p><p>Eric Carle is acclaimed and beloved as the creator of brilliantly illustrated and innovatively designed picture books for very young children. His best-known work, <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>, has eaten its way into the hearts of literally millions of children all over the world and has been translated into more than 25 languages and sold over twelve million copies. Since the <b>Caterpillar</b> was published in 1969, Eric Carle has illustrated more than sixty books, many best sellers, most of which he also wrote.<p>Born in Syracuse, New York, in 1929, Eric Carle moved with his parents to Germany when he was six years old; he was educated there, and graduated from the prestigious art school, the Akademie der bildenden Kunste, in Stuttgart. But his dream was always to return to America, the land of his happiest childhood memories. So, in 1952, with a fine portfolio in hand and forty dollars in his pocket, he arrived in New York. Soon he found a job as a graphic designer in the promotion department of <i>The New York Times</i>. Later, he was the art director of an advertising agency for many years.</p><p>One day, respected educator and author, Bill Martin Jr, called to ask Carle to illustrate a story he had written. Martin's eye had been caught by a striking picture of a red lobster that Carle had created for an advertisement. <b>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</b> was the result of their collaboration. It is still a favorite with children everywhere. This was the beginning of Eric Carle's true career. Soon Carle was writing his own stories, too. His first wholly original book was <b>1,2,3 to the Zoo</b>, followed soon afterward by the celebrated classic, <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>.</p><p>Eric Carle's art is distinctive and instantly recognizable. His art work is created in collage technique, using hand-painted papers, which he cuts and layers to form bright and cheerful images. Many of his books have an added dimension - die-cut pages, twinkling lights as in <b>The Very Lonely Firefly</b>, even the lifelike sound of a cricket's song as in <b>The Very Quiet Cricket</b> - giving them a playful quality: a toy that can be read, a book that can be touched. Children also enjoy working in collage and many send him pictures they have made themselves, inspired by his illustrations. He receives hundreds of letters each week from his young admirers. The secret of Eric Carle's books' appeal lies in his intuitive understanding of and respect for children, who sense in him instinctively someone who shares their most cherished thoughts and emotions.</p><p>The themes of his stories are usually drawn from his extensive knowledge and love of nature - an interest shared by most small children. Besides being beautiful and entertaining, his books always offer the child the opportunity to learn something about the world around them. It is his concern for children, for their feelings and their inquisitiveness, for their creativity and their intellectual growth that, in addition to his beautiful artwork, makes the reading of his books such a stimulating and lasting experience.</p><p>Carle says: "With many of my books I attempt to bridge the gap between the home and school. To me home represents, or should represent; warmth, security, toys, holding hands, being held. School is a strange and new place for a child. Will it be a happy place? There are new people, a teacher, classmates - will they be friendly? I believe the passage from home to school is the second biggest trauma of childhood; the first is, of course, being born. Indeed, in both cases we leave a place of warmth and protection for one that is unknown. The unknown often brings fear with it. In my books I try to counteract this fear, to replace it with a positive message. I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun."</p><p></p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Group (USA) Books for Young Readers.

Bold spreads feature larger-than-life birds and animals enthusiastically partaking of their favorite foods: a mottled snake sucks up unruly spaghetti strands, while a calico cat lays a protective paw on Thursday's roast beef. Though the cumulative rhyme is little more than a grocery list, Carle injects energy and movement with his signature rainbow-like collages. Exotic hues--a turquoise elephant, an emerald fish, a parrot of Technicolor plumage--glow with vitality as if illuminating the animal's inner core. Yet despite their radiance these are down-to-earth animals imbued with the loving clumsiness of a child's artwork. The final spread shows children--also of various skin colors--wolfing down the various foods at a sumptuous banquet, as the featured animals look on from paintings on the wall. The song's music and lyrics bring this feast to a satisfying close.

And his creation LINUX is used by over 12 million people as well as by companies such as IBM.</p><p>Now, in a narrative that zips along with the speed of e-mail, Torvalds gives a history of his renegade software while candidly revealing the quirky mind of a genius. The result is an engrossing portrayal of a man with a revolutionary vision, who challenges our values and may change our world.</p></p><p>Most 31-year olds can't boast of being the instigator of a revolution. But then again, the world's leading promoter of open source software and creator of the operating system Linux does humbly call himself an accidental revolutionary--accidental being the operative word here. <i>Just for Fun</i> is the quirky story of how Linus Torvalds went from being a penniless, introverted code writer in Helsinki in the early 1990s to being the unwitting (and rather less than penniless) leader of a radical shift in computer programming by the end of the decade.<p> OK, perhaps "story" in the traditional sense of the term is stretching it a bit. This whole book is more like a series of e-mails, an exercise in textual communication for someone more used to code language than conversation: choppy sentences packed into short paragraphs, and sometimes just one-liners. The pace is fast, but the quippy tone can get somewhat tiring, though it definitely suits the portrayal of a computer-dominated life. And like an e-mail conversation, the tense often changes, the topics jump back and forth, and the narrators occasionally change, mostly alternating between the Linux man himself and <i>Red Herring</i> executive editor David Diamond, who convinced the difficult-to-pin-down Torvalds to write his story (or at least allow Diamond to poke, prod, and pull it out of him, all the while giving his own impressions and interpretations). But Torvald's tale contains enough informative and entertaining tidbits--on growing up in dark, strangely silent but communication-gadget-obsessed Finland (which boasts more cell phones per capita than anywhere else), on what makes passionate code writers tick, on making the transition from unknown computer geek to world-famous computer geek, on the convergence of technology and ideology, on his work for Transmeta and involvement (or lack thereof) with all the players worth mentioning in Silicon Valley - to keep more than just computer programmers engrossed in his story. For the latter, of course, <i>Just for Fun</i> will be required reading.</p><p> If you pick up this book as a geek's guide to the meaning of life (which, believe it or not, Torvalds does ramble on about at the beginning and the end), then you're in for a bit of a shallow take on the whole thing. But if you're interested in the idea of technological development as a global team sport, and how a nerdy Finnish transplant to California got the whole game going in the first place, check out Linus's story... just for fun, of course. --<i>S. Ketchum</i></p><p>Linus Torvalds was born in Finland. He graduated from the University of Helsinki and lives with his wife, the six-time karate champion of Finland, and his children. Linus currently works as a programmer on several projects for Transmeta.</p><br><br><p>David Diamond has written regularly for such publications as the <em>New York Times, Business Week,</em> and <em>Wired</em>. He is executive editor of <em>Red Herring Magazine</em> and lives in Kentfield, California, with his wife and daughter.</p></p><h2>Communication IQ: A Proven Way to Influence, Lead, and Motivate People (Life Languages)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;By languages, in all their facets, we can live in peace or go to war. We sing songs in harmony, or shout insults in anger. We experience connection or disconnection. We work together in peace or in pain. The choice is ours.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Anna Kendall</i><br> Every so often, we meet people with whom we find it difficult to communicate. For one reason or another, we don&#x2019;t seem to be on the same wavelength&#x2014;it&#x2019;s as if we&#x2019;re speaking different languages. It&#x2019;s frustrating when we try to discuss something with them or understand their point of view.<br> The late renowned management consultant Peter Drucker claimed that 80 percent of all management problems were the result of faulty communication. Poor communication also causes strife in many relationships.<br> Fred and Anna Kendall set out to discover how different people prefer to communicate and what methods they use to do so. The result is the Kendalls&#x2019; Life Languages program, which has been used successfully by tens of thousands of people around the world.<br> In <i>Communication IQ</i>, the Kendalls share information about three communication intelligence categories&#x2014;<b>kinetic/action</b>, <b>emotive/feeling</b>, and <b>cognitive/thinking</b>&#x2014;and the seven Life Languages&#x2014;<b>Mover</b>, <b>Doer</b>, <b>Influencer</b>, <b>Responder</b>, <b>Shaper</b>, <b>Producer</b>, and <b>Contemplator</b>. Each Life Language has a filter through which one views life and communication, a need that provides feelings of acceptance and love when it&#x2019;s met, a key character strength, a learning style, and other traits. The Kendalls&#x2019; goal is to empower people to learn how to use their Life Language to better communicate with others in their personal lives, their careers, and the world at large, while also gaining a greater self-awareness of their own strengths and passions.</p></p><p><p><b>Fred and Anna Kendall</b> are known nationally and internationally as experts in communication and relationships. They have offered their expert advice as hosts or interview guests on more than 800 television and radio programs, including <i>Dr. Phil</i> and <i>Good Morning America</i>. Their interest in helping people understand themselves and others was the catalyst for creating, developing, and perfecting an original system of communication known as the 7 Life Languages. They also developed the Kendall Life Languages Profile (KLLP), an exceptional measurement instrument that determines one&#x2019;s fluency in the seven different communication styles. This foundational product is both diagnostic and prescriptive, providing insightful, positive self-discovery resulting in character-centered communication.</p><p>Fred&#x2019;s eclectic background includes positions such as juvenile probation counselor and officer, area and divisional manager of electronics communications companies, hospital management, and co-ownership of three psychiatric hospital programs and seventeen outpatient centers called LifeCare, located in Ft. Worth, Texas, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Newport Beach, California. He has served on advisory councils and boards of directors for several organizations.</p><p>Anna was the publicist and personal executive assistant to Mary Kay Ash, founder of Mary Kay Cosmetics, Inc., eventually becoming an international senior director. She co-hosted the nationwide radio talk show, <i>Point of View</i>, as well as her own shows, <i>The Christian Home</i> and <i>Love Restores</i>. Anna also hosted <i>LifeCare</i>, a national television talk show on emotional, relational, and professional issues that was syndicated on network and independent stations.</p><p>With Fred&#x2019;s education and experience in military science, psychology, psychometrics, and business, combined with Anna&#x2019;s extensive background in public relations, marketing, advertising, and communications, the Kendalls formed Life Languages Institute, Inc., in 1995.</p><p>For more information, visit www.lifelanguages.com.</p><p>The 7 Life Languages communications profile has been one of the most powerful and effective teaching and training tools that I have had the pleasure of using.

It was truly an awakening to learn how each of us naturally communicated and how those styles had actually created tension and misunderstandings between our close, six-person team. Learning and understanding how each of us communicated enables us to not only understand our differences, but appreciate them and begin to truly utilize each other's strengths and recognize when we were going down the miscommunication rabbit hole and stop it! We later brought the entire management team into the Life Languages program and we have enjoyed similar results. It is a transformative process and we will be taking the next steps in Life Languages soon for our executive team. I have found that close to 100 percent of problems we have, whether internally or with clients, stem from poor communication. Learning the 7 Life Languages has peeled back the mystery and given us real tools to understand ourselves, our teams, and our clients to enable us to reduce the crises and stress that arise from poor communication.--Craig A. Young<br><br>I have utilized the Kendall Life Languages Profile in my professional work in human resources for several years. As many in my profession are aware, successful companies are those organizations where employee engagement is high. Effective communication is a key driver of employee engagement. As we onboard employees to our organization, we emphasize that good communication is the responsibility of all employees. It is one of our core values. All new employees take the Kendall Life Languages Profile. It provides them with insight into their own communication preferences and provides them with information to assimilate and work effectively with their team members. It is also a great tool to understand and remedy conflict within work groups. In addition, when employee performance issues arise, it serves as a reference to help the manager understand how to effectively approach these discussions with the employee. The KLLP is a system that addresses all aspects of the employee life-cycle and is the most effective and comprehensive communication system on the market today.--Leslie Horwitz<br><br>I want to compliment Life Languages International on developing an instrument that is so understandable and accurate.

Before long, he wakes up to find himself jobless, hobbled with debt, spying on his wife's online flirtation, and six days away from losing his home. . . . Until, one night on a desperate two a.m. run to 7-Eleven, he falls in with some local stoners, and they end up hatching the biggest�and most misbegotten�plan yet. </p></p><p><p>Jess Walter is the author of six novels, including the bestsellers <em>Beautiful Ruins</em> and <em>The Financial Lives of the Poets</em>, the National Book Award finalist <em>The Zero</em>, and <em>Citizen Vince</em>, the winner of the Edgar Award for best novel. His short fiction has appeared in <em>Harper's</em>, <em>McSweeney's</em>, and <em>Playboy</em>, as well as <em>The Best American Short Stories</em> and <em>The Best American Nonrequired Reading</em>. He lives in his hometown of Spokane, Washington.</p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Lisa Zeidner Sonnets about hot stock tips? Haiku about adjustable-rate mortgages? In retrospect, maybe it wasn't such a wise move to bet the farm on a Web site that offers financial advice in verse. Matt Prior, the bumbling narrator of Jess Walter's fifth novel, "The Financial Lives of the Poets," admits as much. If poetfolio.com failed to make him a millionaire, Matt thought he could always get his reporting job back. How could he have known that the newspaper business would tank along with the rest of the economy, leaving him at age 46 with no job, no job prospects and six days left before foreclosure on his house? Financial meltdown isn't the only problem facing the devoted husband and father in this deliciously antic tale of an American dream gone very sour. Matt's senile father lives with him after losing his net worth to a Las Vegas stripper. Matt's two boys are having problems at school. His wife, Lisa, is despondent from her own failed entrepreneurial adventure -- a belly-up eBay resale business that has left them with a garage crammed with dreck. She sneaks to her computer for an Internet affair with the heir to a local store called Lumberland. Walter's previous novel, the crisply hallucinatory "The Zero," escorted readers right into the smoke and mangled metal of 9/11. "The Financial Lives of the Poets" is a lighter-hearted concoction, but as in "The Zero," the surreal surprises keep coming. Unable to sleep amid all his troubles, Matt starts smoking marijuana. After an impromptu confab with some suspicious characters at the 7-Eleven, Matt gets the brainstorm to trade in the remaining tatters of his net worth -- a 401(k) that is beginning "to look more like a 4(k)" -- for enough pot to set up his own dealership and dig himself out of the fiscal ditch. The new enterprise goes about as well as you'd expect. The plot may sound as slight as an episode of "Weeds" -- suburban parent cluelessly enters goofy underworld to maintain status quo -- but Matt is no sitcom dad. Part noir gumshoe, part average Joe, he's a sharp, wide-eyed, soulful observer, with a keen eye for the layers of bureaucracy and doublespeak that surround every enterprise, from real estate to the "perpetual blind stalemate" of marriage. The novel delivers a scathing indictment of our country's character and the "ruined systems" we labor under. "Hell, we don't need bailouts, rescue packages and public works," Matt says. "We need more poets." The poems contained herein are not exactly about to grace the pages of the New Yorker. But they sure are funny. Walter gives us Whitman parodies, drug warning labels in rhyme, poems with titles like "Turns Out There Are Only Four Eskimo Words for Snow, However" and poems about hot moms in parking lots. These verses give the narrative the jangly feeling of manic channel-surfing through our nation's recent history. It's a tricky move to write fiction quite this up-to-the-minute. Today's news can quickly feel like yesterday's newspaper. But Walter, a former journalist, has sharp reportorial instincts and brings us right into the maw of current events without ever seeming like he's writing an op-ed instead of a novel. He keeps us rooted in the perceptions of his befuddled, very likable protagonist. Though the story is peppered with all sorts of giddy, hyper-current references -- Facebook, Wikipedia, not to mention the only poem to mention Costco and NPR in the same stanza -- it also has heart and heft. Matt reserves most of his tender nostalgia not for his teetering marriage, but for the newspaper business itself. The closest thing the novel has to a villain is "the Idi Amin of journalism, the Pol Pot of my newspaper, he whose name cannot be typed without befouling a keyboard": the soulless, selfish, budget-minded manager who fires Matt and kills his paper. "It never occurred to me that a newspaper could die," Matt mourns. By the novel's end, he's learned the lesson of middle-aged mortality the hard way: "The edge is so close to where we live." <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Is our inevitable death a bad thing? Would immortality be an improvement? Would it be better, all things considered, to hasten our deaths by suicide? Many people ask these big questions -- and some people are plagued by them. Surprisingly, analytic philosophers have said relatively little about these important questions about the meaning of life. When they have tackled the big questions, they have tended, like popular writers, to offer comforting, optimistic answers. The Human Predicament invites readers to take a clear-eyed and unfettered view of the human condition. <br> <br>David Benatar here offers a substantial, but not unmitigated, pessimism about the central questions of human existence. He argues that while our lives can have some meaning, we are ultimately the insignificant beings that we fear we might be. He maintains that the quality of life, although less bad for some than for others, leaves much to be desired in even the best cases. Worse, death is generally not a solution; in fact, it exacerbates rather than mitigates our cosmic meaninglessness. While it can release us from suffering, it imposes another cost - annihilation. This state of affairs has nuanced implications for how we should think about many things, including immortality and suicide, and how we should think about the possibility of deeper meaning in our lives. Ultimately, this thoughtful, provocative, and deeply candid treatment of life's big questions will interest anyone who has contemplated why we are here, and what the answer means for how we should live.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Benatar</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at University of Cape Town, South Africa. He is the author of <em>Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming Into Existence</em> (2006) and <em>Debating Procreation: Is it Wrong to Reproduce?</em> (2015).<br><br>"<em>The Human Predicament</em> is worth reading for its often insightful discussion of the practical implications of accepting the broad pessimistic contention that all lives are bad when judged by any relevant measure." -- David Matheson, Carleton University, Canada, <em>The Philosophical Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"What thinking person doesn't care about the (possible) meaning and quality of life, the nature and disvalue of death, and the option of suicide? David Benatar addresses these and other engaging and important topics in this well-argued book. The quality of the writing is about as high as any philosophy I can remember reading: short, clear sentences, with not a word wasted or misplaced. I do not see the human predicament as pessimistically as David Benatar does; but I found myself disagreeing less than I expected to -- for example, in his sensitive and probing discussion of suicide." --<em>David DeGrazia, George Washington University</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"David Benatar's new book, <em>The Human Predicament</em>, offers justifiably pessimistic analyses of some of the most interesting and important issues of human existence, including birth, suffering, death, and suicide. Benatar's analyses are as beautifully crafted and written as they are scholarly and thoughtful. <em>The Human Predicament</em> is a grand work of philosophy, but contains important insights for many of the social and life sciences, including psychology, sociology, biology, as well as to medicine and law. Not only will I recommend this book to my colleagues and graduate and undergraduate students, but I also will recommend it to my family and friends. <em>The Human Predicament</em> is a stunning achievement by a deeply compassionate man." -- Todd Shackelford, Distinguished Professor and Chair of Psychology, Oakland University <br> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Why Do English Learners Struggle With Reading?: Distinguishing Language Acquisition From Learning Disabilities</h2><p><p><strong><em>Make the right instructional and eligibility decisions to help your English Learners!&nbsp;</em></strong><br> <br> Do your students&#x2032;&nbsp;reading difficulties reflect language acquisition issues or a learning disability?

When I started, &#x201c;sacred space&#x201d; was just words in a ritual. No one really <br>explained the true meaning of that term to me. &#x201c;Sacred space&#x201d; was just a buzzword. <br>But as I kept saying it as a part of the rituals, I learned. Eventually, the layers of the mystery <br>were revealed to me. I finally understood what sacred space was all about. <br> <br>Looking back on it, it seems so obvious, but the teachings I initially received didn't <br>emphasize the sacred aspects of the craft. Everyone around me was so afraid of using <br>the word &#x201c;religion&#x201d; or &#x201c;spirituality&#x201d;; so much was kept to the technical and philosophical. <br>And at the time, that's what I needed. My emphasis wasn't on the sacred. Now, in <br>my own teachings, I have a hard time divorcing myself from talking about the spiritual <br>path of witchcraft, because it is all part of what led me to my spiritual path. At the moment, <br>if you are like I was, you might not appreciate this. In fact, I can describe it at <br>length and with my own personal stories and meanings, but until you seek spirituality <br>out and start to experience it yourself, my words are meaningless. <br> <br>I've contemplated not sharing these things, but letting my students figure it out for <br>themselves, as I did. I decided not to for one simple reason. For many people, the craft <br>of the witch becomes so focused on spellwork or memorizing rituals that even the <br>concept of the greater meanings and mysteries never cross their minds. The possibility <br>is not contemplated and explored because, for so many, it is unknown. Students will <br>still have to figure it out on their own, truly, because it must experienced. <br> <br>All I hope to do is plant a small seed of awareness, and give you the means to be <br>your own gardener, the means to care for and nurture that seed. You can always <br>choose to grow something else. You can save the seed of truly understanding sacred <br>space for a later time, like I did. Or, you can grow it and make it flourish right now. <br>The choice is up to you. <br> <br>Perfect Love and Perfect Trust <br>Sacred space is simply honoring the sacredness, the divinity, found in all things everywhere. <br>Through the ritual of the witch's circle, we mark a territory, a circle that can be <br>out in nature or in our bedroom, and recognize its sacredness. We acknowledge that <br>this space exists not only in the physical, but also in all worlds, and opens the doorway <br>between the worlds, to be in conscious communion with the sacredness on all levels of <br>reality. Our temple is said to stand not in any one world, but between the worlds, and <br>in all worlds. In our sacred space, there is no separation. Through it we partner with all <br>that is seen and unseen, through perfect love and perfect trust. <br> <br>&#x201c;Perfect love and perfect trust&#x201d; were other buzzwords I heard in circle. Some traditions <br>used them. Others didn't. But no one really explained to me what these important <br>words meant, other than saying &#x201c;sacred space&#x201d; or &#x201c;love and trust.&#x201d; I knew the <br>&#x201c;perfect&#x201d; was a big key to this mystery, but at the time, I was focused on the Moon, <br>and picking the right time to do my spells, rather than really understanding what I was <br>saying. I was told to say &#x201c;perfect love and perfect trust,&#x201d; so I did, but didn't know why <br>and didn't really dwell on it. <br> <br>Only once I ventured out of my safe world of Wicca did I really come to understand <br>these five important words. I developed a very eclectic view of the witch, looking <br>to all traditions, not just Celtic. I studied shamanism, energy healing, Kabalah, <br>yoga, reiki, flower essences, and herbs, purposely looking outside the pagan view. <br>Witchcraft became a vast umbrella for all these disciplines, since its philosophies gave <br>me a great grounding that I noticed many in the &#x201c;New Age&#x201d; world didn't have. As the <br>craft of the wise, I saw all these disciplines as part of witchcraft, though I soon found <br>out many did not. <br> <br>Through this exploration of new techniques and philosophies, I found a common <br>thread: unconditional love. I wasn't big on the word &#x201c;love.&#x201d; I thought it misused. So <br>many people say the word &#x201c;love&#x201d; but never really back it up with any meaning or intent. <br>As a songwriter, I thought of all the trite songs using the word &#x201c;love,&#x201d; and how it <br>has lost its value. So I avoided the word in my creative work. Even in my Witchcraft I <br>class experience, I thought of self-love as self-confidence, assurance, and esteem. But <br>here the word &#x201c;love&#x201d; kept on popping up. I thought these New Age practices a holdover <br>from the 1960s, with vague concepts of free love and spiritual love, and started to question <br>if I was learning anything of real value. Then I felt the love. <br> <br>Through various meditation workshops, one in particular about awakening the <br>heart chakra to unconditional love, I really felt it. I really awakened it. Like all things, I <br>entered a skeptic, but from the first moment, I felt heaviness in my chest. As the day <br>went on, it melted away and I left the weekend course dazzling, light, and with an <br>open heart. Not only did I feel this nebulous unconditional love coursing through me, <br>I had a sense that I am the love, too. Everyone is. <br> <br>While reflecting on that experience in my Book of Shadows journal, I skimmed <br>through my notes and realized that the first time I felt this type of love was in the <br>witch's circle. It wasn't the same because I was not taught to really focus on it as a <br>witch. In the workshop, that was the purpose of the entire weekend. But it was present <br>in the first magickal circle, even if I had my eyes closed to it. I traced the teaching <br>of this unconditional love back, and the start of my personal thread was in witchcraft <br>classes, through perfect love and perfect trust. <br> <br>Slowly on the intellectual level, I began to distinguish the difference between what <br>my society had been calling love, what I would later call personal love, and what the <br>mystics call unconditional love. Witches call it perfect love. Unconditional love is just <br>that: perfect, unattached, without limits and restraints. This love simply is, and to me <br>it is the binding force of the universe. In the ITOW, we covered the Hermetic principle <br>called the Principle of Mentalism, stating &#x201c;We are all thoughts in the divine mind,&#x201d; <br>meaning we are all part of a greater whole. I wish there was another principle stating <br>we are all pulses within the divine heart, because it is through this heart we truly feel <br>the unity, even though the mind can intellectually know it. With unconditional love, <br>you are loved simply because you exist. You are love. <br> <br>With personal love, that is our relationship love, be it familial, romantic, or friendship. <br>There are often conditions to it and it sometimes seems to come with a struggle. <br>The dichotomy between unconditional love and personal love, what mainstream society <br>simply refers to both as love, pushed me to avoid the concept altogether. Unfortunately, <br>English often lacks the subtleties of other languages, particularly on the spiritual <br>concepts. Many other languages have separate words for differing kinds of love. <br>Perfect trust is a divine sense of knowing and security with the creative spirit, the <br>Goddess and God. We work actively to partner with the divine ones, through our magick <br>and meditations, realizing that we are all part of that divine mind. But when things <br>seem confusing, when our guidance isn't clear, when our magick isn't working as we <br>planned, and when we are suffering tragedy, we have a trust in the divine through our <br>knowing of being unconditionally loved. It isn't logical or rational, but when we truly <br>experience and know it, no personal challenge will ever be viewed the same way again. <br>Perfect trust runs both ways. As we have it through this unconditional love for the <br>divine, we know the Goddess and God have it for us. They trust us to fulfill our parts <br>of the pattern. We have infinite choices and freedom as to how we serve the large pattern <br>and fulfill our parts, but we trust that all actions can serve the greater spiraling <br>pattern of the universe. <br> <br>Through practicing the rituals of perfect love and perfect trust, through creating <br>sacred space, we grow in our sense of connection and love. Even if we don't initially <br>feel it, it is there, growing and expanding in our awareness, until we are ready. We best <br>manifest our desires, our magick, through truly feeling our connection to the Goddess, <br>the God, and all the universe. We connect and create sacred space through the perfect <br>love and perfect trust the divine has for us, and we have for them. If everything is sacred, <br>all the time, and we simply do our rituals to open the door to a partnership with <br>the sacred, everything is therefore filled with this unconditional love, this perfect love <br>and perfect trust. All we have to do is open our eyes to it, in and out of our rituals. <br>The challenge we have, as those walking the spiritual path of witchcraft, is to inject <br>more and more perfect love and perfect trust, or sacredness, to all thoughts and actions <br>in our life, bringing it to every relationship and exchange. No small feat to accomplish, <br>but this is the path of enlightenment, taken one step at a time. As overused as the say- <br>ing may be, it truly is the journey, and not the destination, when walking the witch's <br>road. <br> <br>The most important lesson I've learned in applying perfect love and perfect trust to <br>the world is that unconditional love doesn't mean unconditional relationships. You can <br>hold a sacred love for someone in your heart, and honor that person as a living being, <br>as a spiritual soul, but you can draw a boundary for your own health and well-being. <br>Unconditional love doesn't mean you encourage others to walk all over you and hurt <br>you. As the witch's circle casts a boundary of sacred space, I think it is an important reminder <br>that we, too, while in the physical plane, have appropriate boundaries of our <br>own space, health, and well-being. <br> <br>Return to the Inner Temple <br>Before we go forward in our work, we should reflect on the inner temple. In ITOW, <br>the lessons focused on finding a sacred space within yourself, on the inner planes of reality. <br>Only through finding the sacredness on the unseen planes can you truly open the <br>doorways between worlds and create a temple of sacred space intersecting with the <br>physical world through the rituals of witchcraft. <br> <br>A key lesson of this previous work was to gain the discipline to enter a meditative <br>state, a level of altered consciousness where you can perceive energy more easily and direct <br>it with your will. In the ritual state, you will not go as deep as in meditative, but understanding <br>how to enter both levels of consciousness, easily at anytime, is a measure of <br>a truly well-trained witch. Laurie Cabot used to say to my class that you should be able <br>to enter alpha state while riding a crowded subway train. I don't recommend it, since <br>that might blind you to the dangers of urban travel, but in theory, you should be able to <br>do it. <br> <br>The discipline aspect bothers some students. Feeling witchcraft is light, spacy, and <br>free, they don't understand the need for discipline. Discipline is one aspect of the craft, <br>but an important one. It is the earthy foundation upon which all other free and ecstatic <br>practices are built. It is easy to get distracted, physically or magickally, and proper <br>discipline lets us keep our focus clear regardless of distractions or surprises. <br>When in the sacred space, all thoughts become thoughts of creation. Without <br>mental discipline, you might create something you don't want. There are all sorts of <br>precautions built into the rituals for this reason, but the best precaution is self-awareness. <br>When I first started in Wicca, I was untrained in my first circle. Although it was <br>a very magickal experience on all levels, I couldn't help but have distracting thoughts: <br>&#x201c;Is this real? I feel silly wearing a robe. Wow, the Moon came out from behind the <br>clouds when she called it.&#x201d; <br> <br>I even had thoughts from my previous years of Catholicism, thinking, &#x201c;Uh oh, perhaps <br>I was wrong about this witchcraft thing. Perhaps God is mad at me for this and <br>we are going to Hell.&#x201d; Not the best thoughts to be having in a sacred space, but perfectly <br>understandable. I had them flash in my mind, and hear many first-time witches <br>feel the same thing, but feel embarrassed to admit it. Thankfully none of us created <br>from those thoughts, but the circle space can intensify all feelings. Some people feel <br>overwhelmed in the sacred space. They are usually people who are undisciplined or <br>ungrounded in themselves and their own self-image and self-esteem. Such energy can <br>be overwhelming even to one fully aware, depending on the ritual. <br> <br>The key to fully integrate into the sacred space and be open to the most magickal <br>of experiences is the ability to clear the mind, enter an altered state, and tune into the <br>sacred energies within you and the circle, to bring balance and harmony. Some people <br>can do it naturally without any training, but the best way I've found to teach it to others <br>is to learn the discipline of meditation. <br> <br>Altered States <br>To work magick and meditation, you must be able to enter an altered state, often <br>called gnosis. In magick, an altered state is any level of brain activity that is different <br>from normal waking activity that helps you process energy, will, and intuition. <br>Our states of consciousness are based on brain wave activity. The four states we are <br>more concerned about are beta, alpha, theta, and delta. Beta is normal waking consciousness, <br>at thirteen to sixteen hertz, or cycles, per second. Alpha is the magickal <br>state most people talk about, a light meditative state clocking in at eight to thirteen cycles <br>per second. When we visualize creatively, daydream, meditate, and enter a light <br>hypnotic state, we are in alpha. Theta is a deeper state, ranging from four to eight <br>hertz. The lowest state is delta, at four or less hertz. <br> <br>Alpha is the state we are most involved in for this book. Light states of alpha are <br>called ritual consciousness. You must be open and aware to energy and intuition, but <br>not so deep that you are immobile. During rituals you still need to speak, light candles, <br>read spells, and perform other actions. In group rituals, you need to be aware of silent <br>cues and group dynamics while still maintaining your magickal awareness. On the <br>deeper levels of alpha, moving toward theta, we enter a more immobile, deeper awareness, <br>tuning into the inner planes. Some totally block out the physical world, while others <br>are true walkers between the worlds, aware of both the inner reality and outer <br>world simultaneously. I've had both experiences, depending on my own times of personal <br>power and awareness. Neither is better than the other, as long as it works for you. <br>Learn this technique to enter a meditative state. Use only the first countdown <br>when needing to enter ritual consciousness. Do the complete countdown for deeper <br>meditation and journeying. <br> <br><b>EXERCISE 1 <br> <br><i>Entering an Altered State <br></i></b>1. Get into a comfortable position.

In 1975, the Khmer Rouge seized power in the capital city of Phnom Penh. Immediately after declaring victory in the war, they set about evacuating the country&#x2019;s major cities with the brutal ruthlessness and disregard for humanity that characterized the regime ultimately responsible for the deaths of one million citizens.</p><p>Cartoonist Tian Veasna was born just three days after the Khmer Rouge takeover, as his family set forth on the chaotic mass exodus from Phnom Penh. <i>Year of the Rabbit</i> is based on firsthand accounts, all told from the perspective of his parents and other close relatives. Stripped of any money or material possessions, Veasna&#x2019;s family found themselves exiled to the barren countryside along with thousands of others, where food was scarce and brutal violence a constant threat.</p><p><i>Year of the Rabbit</i> shows the reality of life in the work camps, where Veasna&#x2019;s family bartered for goods, where children were instructed to spy on their parents, and where reading was proof positive of being a class traitor. Constantly on the edge of annihilation, they realized there was only one choice&#x2015;they had to escape Cambodia and become refugees. Veasna has created a harrowing, deeply personal account of one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest tragedies.</p></p><p><b>Tian Veasna</b> was born in Cambodia in 1975, three days after the Khmer Rouge came to power. He moved to France with his parents in 1980, where he graduated from Strasbourg&#x2019;s �cole des Arts D�coratifs in 2001. After that he returned to Cambodia for the first time, offering drawing classes as part of a United Nations humanitarian project. Since then Veasna has worked in publishing, taught visual art, and cofounded the workshop and gallery space Le Bocal, which specializes in illustration and graphic art. Veasna&#x2019;s desire to recount what his family lived through in 1975 led him to return to Cambodia frequently and record the memories of his family members. Those stories became <i>Year of the Rabbit</i>, his first book. Veasna lives in France.</p><h2>Mastering Hebrew Calligraphy</h2><p>Mastering Hebrew Calligraphy is a comprehensive and beautiful guide to the art of Hebrew letter-making.

In a book that is part reportage, part history, part social commentary, Tanner Colby explores why the civil rights movement ultimately produced such little true integration in schools, neighborhoods, offices, and churches&#x2014;the very places where social change needed to unfold. Weaving together the personal, intimate stories of everyday people&#x2014;black and white&#x2014;Colby reveals the strange, sordid history of what was supposed to be the end of Jim Crow, but turned out to be more of the same with no name. He shows us how far we have come in our journey to leave mistrust and anger behind&#x2014;and how far all of us have left to go.&nbsp;</p></p><p>"I've often thought that the issue of race has been more than adequately dealt with by America's people of color and that it was finally white&nbsp;people's turn to engage with the uncomfortable subject if we were to move forward together as a nation. In <i>Some of My Best Friends Are Black</i>, Tanner Colby bravely and ably accepts the challenge. This book taught me unexpected and valuable lessons about my country, my people, and myself. What can a white guy named Tanner teach a black guy named Baratunde about race in America? Turns out the answer is 'plenty.'" -- Baratunde Thurston, author of <i>How to be Black</i><br> <i></i><br> "In weaving together the personal narratives (including his own) of "the Children of White&nbsp; Flight" and "the Children of the Dream" Tanner Colby has crafted a powerful piece of social commentary and contemporary history. Hugely readable, quirky, and incredibly smart, <i>Some of my Best Friends Are Black</i> presents four unforgettable smaller stories to tell the big story of race in today's America." -- Tim Naftali, author of <i>George H.W. Bush</i> and director emeritus of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum<br> <br> "Irony, surprise, virtue, and hustling are always the interwoven story of ethnic troubles in America. Tanner Colby lets us see that, however many advances have been accomplished, the unfamiliar styles of those who intend to do well--along with those who inevitably pollute any area with short-sighted economic dreams--inevitably lead to a universal conclusion: "Mistakes were made." The story of how and why this happened is what gives this book something special beyond the usual sentimentality imposed on human events, above and below." -- Stanley Crouch, author of <i>Reconsidering the Souls of Black Folk</i><b>Tanner Colby</b> is the author of <i>Belushi: A Biography</i> and the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts.</i> He lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p><h2>MELT Performance: A Step-by-Step Program to Accelerate Your Fitness Goals, Improve Balance and Control, and Prevent Chronic Pain and Injuries for Life</h2><p><p>This long-awaited follow-up to the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling <em>The MELT Method</em> introduces a unique, scientific-based proactive training program for improving overall balance, performance, and control while preventing pain and injury.<br><br>Are you an athlete facing constant injuries that hold you back from achieving peak performance?

Lindsey Norris cried from the family restroom in the children's area of the Briar Creek Public Library. There was an inch of water on the floor, and the water spilling over the toilet bowl showed no signs of slowing.<br><br>The harried mother and daughter who had just been in the restroom stood by the door, with the young girl giving Lindsey big worried looks while the mother gushed apologies almost as fast as the toilet spilled water.<br><br>"I'm so sorry, so sorry, so very, very sorry," Kimberly Curtis said.<br><br>"It's fine," Lindsey lied. "Happens all the time."<br><br>She glanced down at the young girl, Madison Curtis, who was pulling her winter hat over her face as if to hide. She peeked at Lindsey from under the edge and said, "I sorry. Ducky wanted to swim."<br><br>Lindsey felt her lips turn up in spite of the situation. She glanced at Kimberly and said, "It does make sense on one level."<br><br>Kimberly hugged her daughter and gave Lindsey an appreciative glance. "You're very kind, but there is nothing logical about flushing a stuffed duck down the toilet."<br><br>"Here's the mop!"<br><br>Lindsey glanced past Kimberly and Madison at her second in command. Her longtime friend Beth Stanley was coming at her with a mop in one hand and a plunger in the other, or more accurately, a mop under one wing and a plunger under the other.<br><br>"Wild guess here," Lindsey said as she took in Beth's bright yellow hooded sweatshirt with wings on the sleeves and an orange beak and two large eyes sewn onto the hood. "Make Way for Ducklings for story time?"<br><br>"McCloskey is the man!" Beth said. "Yes, we read all the feathered faves: The Story about Ping; Come Along, Daisy! and The Ugly Duckling, natch."<br><br>"Well, you inspired little Madison here to set one free," Lindsey said.<br><br>"Uh-oh," Beth said. She looked past Lindsey at the bathroom floor.<br><br>"It's fine. I changed into my boots," Lindsey said. She pointed to her L.L.Bean snow boots. "I'll just waddle on in there and shut the water off."<br><br>"I'll help. I'm in boots, too. They look like duck feet, don't you think?" Beth asked.<br><br>"They do," Lindsey agreed. She looked at Kimberly and Madison. "We're going to start cleaning, and then I'm going to call our maintenance people from the town and see if they can get your duck out of the pipes."<br><br>Madison's face crumpled, and she looked like she was going to have a complete meltdown. Beth, ever in touch with her story timers, saw the brewing storm and started having a conversation with Madison's duck.<br><br>"You're going where? Oh, sorry," she called into the toilet. She glanced at them with a chagrined look. "I forgot to speak in duck." She turned back to the toilet and said, "Quack, quack quackety quackers."<br><br>Madison's face went from distraught to hopeful. Beth kept up the conversation, making Madison laugh while Kimberly leaned close to Lindsey and said, "We won't need Fluffy back. When Madison made it her go-to stuffie, Beth advised me to buy more of the same. I bought three of them, and I rotate them in and out so they have the same amount of wear."<br><br>"Brilliant," Lindsey whispered back. Then she hurried into the bathroom to shut the water off.<br><br>"Where did Fluffy go?" Madison asked Beth. Her four-year-old voice was so pitiful that Lindsey wanted to hug her.<br><br>"Fluffy says she's going to visit her sister and she'll be back"-Beth paused to look at Kimberly, who nodded-"after dinner."<br><br>Madison beamed and clapped her hands as Beth and Lindsey sloshed back toward them.<br><br>"What do you say, Madison?" Kimberly asked her daughter.<br><br>"Thank you," Madison hugged Beth around the knees and then did the same to Lindsey.<br><br>"You're welcome," they said together. They waved as the mother and daughter bundled up to go out into the February cold.<br><br>"Maintenance is never going to get that duck out of there, are they?" Lindsey asked.<br><br>"Not a chance," Beth said. "But it's okay. Kim is smart and has backups."<br><br>"So she said. Great advice you gave her there."<br><br>"Sometimes I pull a good one out of my beak," Beth joked. "Quack."<br><br>"Clark from maintenance just called. They are fixing an electrical issue with the town garage and can't get back here until late this afternoon," Ms. Cole said as she joined them. She looked at the bathroom with disapproval and added, "When Mr. Tupper was director we never had plumbing issues."<br><br>"That's ridicu-" Beth protested, but Lindsey interrupted her.<br><br>"Thank you for calling them, Ms. Cole," Lindsey said.<br><br>When she had taken the job as director of the small town library a couple of years ago, she'd had no idea that her skill set would expand to include basic plumbing, but then there were a lot of things she hadn't expected when she took this job. She supposed the unexpected was what kept it interesting.<br><br>She glanced at her watch; speaking of interesting, she had a meeting to attend. Her weekly crafternoon group was scheduled for one hour from now, and she knew what she had to do. Mop.<br><br>�Hurry!� Beth said as she and Lindsey hustled down the hallway.<br><br>Lindsey was surprised at how much of an important part of her life their weekly crafternoon meetings had become for her over the past couple of years.<br><br>Briar Creek was a small town nestled on the coast of Connecticut. Its claim to fame was that Captain Kidd had once buried treasure out in the Thumb Islands, which numbered into the hundreds if you counted big rocks in the bay. As of yet, no one had found the treasure, although plenty had tried.<br><br>When Lindsey had become the director of the library, she knew that in order to survive, she had to make the library a place where people really enjoyed spending time. One of her very first ideas had been to form a crafternoon club, a group of women who met every Thursday for lunch, book talk and crafting. Men were welcome, too, but so far they'd had no takers.<br><br>Instead of a program for the library, what Lindsey had gotten was a close-knit group of friends who shared her love of food and books and tolerated her inability to craft. She adored each and every one of them.<br><br>She and Beth skidded into the room to find the lunchtime meeting already under way. Nancy Peyton, Lindsey's landlord, was leading the discussion.<br><br>"Inspector Grant," Nancy said. "What do we think of him, ladies?"<br><br>Her short gray hair was cut to flatter her large sparkling blue eyes. She was dressed in her usual turtleneck sweater and slacks with a heavy chambray shirt over the sweater to keep out the winter chill.<br><br>"I like him," Violet La Rue said. "He has spunk."<br><br>Lindsey smiled as she and Beth hit the buffet spread and loaded up their plates. Violet would know a spunky personality since she had one herself. A retired star of the Broadway theater scene, Violet dressed in long flowing caftans in brilliant jewel tones. She wore her thick gray hair in a knot on the back of her head. While about the same age as Nancy, Violet's brown complexion was wrinkle free except for several tiny lines at the corners of her eyes, which only showed when she laughed, which she did quite often.<br><br>Given both Violet's and Nancy's feisty ways, it was no surprise to Lindsey that they approved of Inspector Grant, the hero of this week's book under discussion, The Daughter of Time by Josephine Tey.<br><br>"Hurry up, you two, before we get to the good stuff," Charlene La Rue ordered.<br><br>Charlene was Violet's daughter and just as lovely as her mother. Charlene worked in New Haven as a newscaster but spent her off time in Briar Creek with her husband and children, as her children loved to help their grandmother with whatever community theater project she had under way.<br><br>Charlene had been in charge of the food this week, and it consisted of a large casserole dish filled with shepherd's pie, an arugula salad, sweet tea and chocolate cream pie for dessert. The shepherd's pie was still hot, and Lindsey felt her mouth begin to water. She'd had no idea that swabbing a bathroom floor could cause such an appetite.<br><br>"The good stuff?" Mary Murphy asked. "Are we talking about the food or the book?"<br><br>Mary Murphy was a pretty brunette who owned the local caf&#x17d; the Blue Anchor with her husband, Ian Murphy. She was also the younger sister of Lindsey's ex-boyfriend Captain Mike Sullivan, known to everyone locally as Sully.<br><br>Lindsey always appreciated that Mary was able to separate their friendship from Lindsey's relationship with her brother, although Mary did lobby on her brother's behalf every chance she got.<br><br>"The book, definitely the book," Charlene said.<br><br>"Speaking of which," Nancy paused and her eyes twinkled as she looked at Lindsey. "Can you imagine trying to solve the mystery of whether King Richard III murdered the princes in the tower just because you were hospitalized with a broken leg and were bored? Who does that sort of thing, solve mysteries just because?"<br><br>Lindsey shoved a forkful of salad into her mouth and then pointed to her lips to indicate she couldn't talk right now because she was chewing.<br><br>Charlene laughed. She scooted over on the couch so that Lindsey could sit next to her. Then she looked at Lindsey and said, "she's teasing you."<br><br>Lindsey swallowed. "You think?"<br><br>Beth took a seat on the other couch next to Mary and said to Lindsey, "We could always talk about who you're dating if that would be more comfortable than your inclination for amateur sleuthing."<br><br>"Did you know that The Daughter of Time was written in nineteen fifty-one, shortly before Tey's death? It was her last novel and was voted number one on the list of top one hundred crime novels of all time by the UK Crime Writers' Association in nineteen ninety."<br><br>Mary shook her head at her. "That was the worst attempt at a subject change ever in the history of our meetings."<br><br>"Obviously, Lindsey does not wish to discuss her personal life," Violet said. "We should respect that."<br><br>"We should," Nancy agreed. "But we're not going to, are we?"<br><br>"Of course not," Mary said. "So, how is the old love life?"<br><br>Lindsey gave her a stubborn look. "I'm not dating anyone right now, so it's steady as she goes, thank you very much."<br><br>"Really?" Mary asked. She sounded disappointed. "Not even a lunch date?"<br><br>"No breakfast, lunch or dinner dates," Lindsey said. "Or any other kind of date, for that matter."<br><br>"So, you're not dating at all?" Violet clarified. She caught Lindsey with her hawklike stare, and Lindsey turned to Charlene.<br><br>"I bet you never lie to her," she said. "She'd catch you in a nanosecond."<br><br>"That stare is like getting blasted with a laser gun," Charlene agreed. "It's kept me on my toes my whole life."<br><br>"It's sort of like Tey's hero Inspector Grant and his ability to judge a person's character by their face," Lindsey said.<br><br>"It doesn't keep you from changing the subject though, does it?" Violet asked, looking a bit put out.<br><br>Lindsey grinned. Violet had a horse in the race for Lindsey's affections, an actor friend of hers named Robbie Vine, who was ridiculously charming and also married, adding to what was already a complicated situation.<br><br>"Speaking of Inspector Grant's uncanny ability," Lindsey said. "Do you think it's possible?"<br><br>"To read a person's character from their face? I wish," Beth said. She pushed her salad around her plate with her fork. "Every time I think I've nailed it, the guy turns out to be a toad. I've dated more than my share of toads. I'm surprised I don't have warts."<br><br>"But I thought you had a nice time with that young banker you went out to dinner with last week," Nancy said.<br><br>"Ugh," Beth grunted. "He's all about conspicuous consumption, you know, the big house, expensive car, designer label life. So shallow."<br><br>"That's too bad," Violet said. She patted Beth's shoulder. "Don't you worry, the right one will come along."<br><br>"Speaking of the right one," Charlene said.<br><br>She turned her reporter's gaze on Lindsey, who immediately hopped up from her seat before the conversation could veer back to her personal life.<br><br>"Do we have enough paper for the paper flowers we're making?" she asked. "Maybe I should go check on that."<br><br>She crossed the room to their crafting table. Today they we making bouquets of paper roses out of recycled office paper. Lindsey planned to use the bouquets to decorate the library and help fight off the winter doldrums.<br><br>Starting with scrap paper with words printed on them, they employed a template to cut the petals out, then they colored just the edges of the paper to give the flowers some pop. Next they would use a glue gun to layer the petals from biggest to smallest.

She loved them all dearly, but she didn't want to talk about her love life, since she barely had a handle on it herself. In truth, it wasn't complicated so much as it was none of their business, but that seemed rude to say.<br><br>"Lindsey, can I talk to you for a sec?"<br><br>Lindsey glanced up at the door to see their library clerk Ann Marie Martin standing there. The ladies all greeted Ann Marie warmly, and Nancy promised to bake a batch of molasses cookies for Ann Marie to bring home to her two precocious boys.<br><br>When Lindsey had started at the library, Ann Marie had dressed in the standard-issue mom ponytail and corduroy jumper, but as the boys had gotten older and were more occupied in school, Ann Marie was letting her dark brown hair down and dressing in tailored slacks and pretty sweaters. Still, she always smelled like cinnamon and apples, which Lindsey found comforting.<br><br>There was no question that Ann Marie was looking much more professional these days. An idea wriggled in the back of Lindsey's brain, but she pushed it aside for the moment, focusing instead on her employee.<br><br>"What can I do for you?" Lindsey asked.<br><br>"We finally got that book in for Stewart Rosen," Ann Marie said. She held up the book in question. It was a medical text that they'd borrowed from a university for him. "They're giving us a very short turnaround on it. Just two weeks."<br><br>Lindsey glanced at the title and nodded. "Stewart will want this right away, then."<br><br>"That's what I was thinking," Ann Marie said.

The country's people still lived under a feudal system like that of Europe in the Middle Ages. But everything began to change when American Commodore Perry and his troops sailed to the Land of the Rising Sun, bringing with them new science and technology, and a new way of life.</p></p><p><p>Rhoda Blumberg has written about the opening of Japan (1853-1854) in Commodore Perry in the <em>Land of the Shogun,</em> a Newbery Honor Book, which also won the Boston Globe/Horn Book Award and the Golden Kite Award. Her acclaimed histories also include <em>The Incredible Journey of Lewis &amp; Clark, The Great American Gold Rush,</em> and <em>The Remarkable Voyages of Captain Cook,</em> all ALA Notable Books. She is the winner of the <em>Washington Post/</em>Children's Book Guild Award for her overall contribution to nonfiction.</p><p>Rhoda Blumberg says that while doing research for <em>Commodore Perry,</em> "I read about the ordeals and strange adventures of Manjiro, then spent years replaying his life story in my mind until I felt impelled to write about him."</p><p>The author and her husband, Gerald, live in Yorktown Heights, New York.</p>Grade 5 Up Blumberg's book succeeds on two levels. First it is a well-written story of Matthew Perry's expedition to open Japan to American trade and whaling ports. The account is sensitive to the extreme cultural differences that both the Japanese and Americans had to overcome. Especially good are the chapters and paragraphs explaining Japanese feudal society and culture. The text is marvelously complemented by the illustrations, almost all reproductions of contemporary Japanese art, underscoring the unbiased approach of the book. On the second level, the book is a well-researched chronicle of the events of the trip. Blumberg has gone to the original sources to capture the sights, emotions, reactions and even tastes of both the Japanese and Americans. Yet she has not neglected the political and economic importance or mission of Perry's trip. The notes, appendixes and bibliography show a carefully thought out book which holds valuable information for sophisticated readers. There is no better book for students on this historical event.

Paralleling the Brazos River, it meandered through lush, semitropical countryside on its way to the Gulf of Mexico. Along the 4300 block of Skinner Lane, unruly brush and tall grasses crowded around as if trying to hide the creek from strangers&#x2019; eyes. At one spot, a football field&#x2013;size patch of lily pads consumed its whole width. Oyster shells littered its banks, hobby fishermen harvested its bounty and alligators patrolled its length for prey.</p><p>In July 2011, in the Pecan Grove community, another deadly creature desecrated its waters.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, July 24, 2011, detectives searching for a missing North Carolina woman made a gruesome discovery tangled up in the weeds growing by the edge of the creek: a piece of armless female torso, severed at the neck and just above the hip area. By four o&#x2019;clock, they&#x2019;d found the rest of the torso. They strongly suspected that they&#x2019;d found the body of the woman whom they were seeking, but without a head or hands, identification would depend on the slow, methodical process of DNA testing.</p><p>The next morning, just after nine, dive experts from the Richmond Fire Department and the Houston Police Department arrived at the scene. The near-100-degree sun beat down on their heads and stabbed into their backs with the single-minded intensity of a carrion crow. Humidity soared over 90 percent, adding to the oppressive atmosphere. Even the temperature of the water was 89 degrees. The smell of decomposition filled their lungs as they stood on the bank assessing the situation to help them define their target area.</p><p>Two divers, Brian Davis and Mark Thorsen of the Houston Police Department, plunged into the hot, dark, murky creek. They started their search at the boat secured to the bank. The tender stood still, holding a line connected to a diver, who traveled out in 180-degree arcs. Each time the man in the water completed a run, the man on the bank fed out more line, which slightly extended the distance from the bank and allowed the diver to traverse a wider semicircle. When searching for something large&#x2014;like a car&#x2014;the line feeds out fast; but today, as they were hunting for body parts, the process was far more deliberate, methodical and slow. Visibility was nonexistent, forcing the divers to feel blindly with their hands in the black water and to depend as much on luck as on skill in their search for more body parts.</p><p>Since the detectives were aware that the missing woman had a tattoo on her foot, they focused first on finding that, since it could be an easy and quick identifier. Since the foot has less muscular tissue than other body parts, it would not float to the surface readily, so they performed an underwater scuba search for one hundred feet in every direction. Sinking to the bottom, the divers made snow angels in the mud, seeking foreign objects on the riverbed&#x2014;all to no avail.</p><p>The lily pads were a major nuisance, covering 50 to 60 percent of the surface of the designated search area. It was impossible to take a boat through them, and every time the divers pushed them out of the way, the current pushed them back. It was a constant struggle.</p><p>Noticing a spot of sheen on the surface of the water, an indicator of decomposition, divers Davis and Thorsen scooped up a sample and returned to shore. Cadaver-dog handlers presented it to their canines, who hit on the scent, indicating the presence of human remains and sending the divers back to that spot to continue their task. Near the area of the sheen, the smell of decomposition was strong. Searching on the surface, Davis spotted a suspicious object tangled among the roots of the lily pads. Pulling it upward, he saw a smooth, hairless bone in the middle of a dark mass. At first he thought he&#x2019;d found a femur bone, and he called Thorsen over to help with the recovery. However, when they rolled it over, a face was revealed, and Davis realized what he had seen was actually the back of a skull. The water had held the skin and muscle in place, but when they pulled the head to the surface, it started sliding off the bone.</p><p>The two men placed a ribbon on the surface where they found the skull and made measurements of its location from two stationary objects. After shooting photos of the area of their find, they wrapped the head in a sheet and carried it to the bank.</p><p>The smell of decomposition was still strong at the spot of sheen, prompting the two divers to return to the water and continue searching. Fifteen to twenty feet deeper into the mass of lilies, they found a portion of a leg. Both of the parts they located that day were on the outer edges of the hot zone. Altogether, over two days, 60 percent of a body had been recovered and delivered to the Galveston County Medical Examiner&#x2019;s Office.</p><p>On Tuesday, the dive team returned, expanding the target area farther but finding nothing more. Nonetheless, they had all that was needed to make identification. The detectives had found the missing woman from Kinston, North Carolina, nearly thirteen hundred miles away, in Oyster Creek in Texas: twenty-seven-year-old businesswoman and mother of two Laura Jean Ackerson.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>LAURA Jean Ackerson was born on April 30, 1984, to Rodger and Brenda Ackerson in Hastings, Michigan, the only city in rural Barry County in the southwest corner of the state. There were six other children in the family, including her father&#x2019;s son, Jason, who was three years older than Laura.</p><p>When Laura was a toddler, Rodger and Brenda separated. The battle of unsubstantiated allegations and contentious finger-pointing that lead to the divorce inflicted emotional scars on everyone, fracturing family relationships and leaving the children with conflicting loyalties. In Laura, the long-term emotional damage was apparent even after she reached adulthood.</p><p>In 1996, Laura and her mother moved to Iowa. Laura attended Lynnville-Sully High School in the tiny town of Sully and graduated in 2003 (a year later than she should have, due to the many disruptions in her home life).</p><p>Her half brother, Jason, left Michigan for North Carolina when he turned twenty-two, though he and Laura continued to keep in touch by phone a couple of times a month. Not long after Jason got a place in Youngsville, a half-hour drive northeast of Raleigh, Laura headed south to join him. Dead-end jobs, worse relationship choices, and frustrations with her home life had left Laura yearning for a new start. Although Youngsville was located in the prosperous and thriving Research Triangle area of North Carolina, it was still a small, rural town with a population under twelve hundred. It certainly wasn&#x2019;t a hotbed of employment opportunities, nor was it full of the entertainments and activities a twenty-year-old woman would crave. Laura lived there with her brother for six months before setting out for the brighter life of the far more cosmopolitan city of Raleigh to find a job and a place of her own.</p><p>In 2004, Laura started working for an Applebee&#x2019;s restaurant in Raleigh. She had the right stuff to be a good waitress: a cheerful, perky personality and girl-next-door good looks with an engaging smile and shoulder-length brown hair. There she met coworker Heidi Schumacher, a bright young woman with an equally sweet smile and longer hair that she sometimes wore up. The two women hit it off right away. After a short while, they both moved on to new jobs, initially together at the Front Row Sports Bar, though Heidi soon moved on to pursue an insurance career.</p><p>Laura had started taking online classes at Kirkwood Community College while living with her brother, and after earning her associate of arts degree from Kirkwood in 2005, she thought about a career in real estate, and took a seventy-five-hour prelicensing course at JY Monk Real Estate School that same year. Her natural talents and interests were stimulated, however, by two classes she took at the community college, one in graphic design and the other in marketing. She decided to focus on developing her graphic-arts skills and obtaining the necessary marketing acumen needed to start her own business. In her spare time, by using the Internet, the library and networking, Laura built on her academic introduction, absorbing all the knowledge she could to pave the path for her future. And to pay the bills in the meantime, she also worked for Bassett Furniture Direct in Raleigh doing retail sales and helping customers with decorating solutions.</p><p>Even though they were on different trajectories, the two friends continued to stay in contact through regular e-mail, live chat and phone calls along with occasional face-to-face m...</p></p><h2>If Picasso Painted a Snowman (The Reimagined Masterpiece Series)</h2><p><p><strong><strong>Maryland Blue Crab Honor Book 2018</strong></strong></p><p>A big, brightly colored, playful introduction to various important painters and art movements.<br></p><p>If someone asked you to paint a snowman, you would probably start with three white circles stacked one upon another. Then you would add black dots for eyes, an orange triangle for a nose, and a black dotted smile. But if Picasso painted a snowman...<br></p><p>From that simple premise flows this delightful, whimsical, educational picture book that shows how the artist&#x2019;s imagination can summon magic from a prosaic subject. Greg Newbold&#x2019;s chameleon-like artistry shows us Roy Lichtenstein&#x2019;s snow hero saving the day, Georgia O&#x2019;Keefe&#x2019;s snowman blooming in the desert, Claude Monet&#x2019;s snowmen among haystacks, Grant Wood&#x2019;s American Gothic snowman, Jackson Pollock&#x2019;s snowman in ten thousand splats, Salvador Dali&#x2019;s snowmen dripping like melty cheese, and snowmen as they might have been rendered by J. M. W. Turner, Gustav Klimt, Paul Klee, Marc Chagall, Georges Seurat, Pablita Velarde, Piet Mondrian, Sonia Delaunay, Jacob Lawrence, and Vincent van Gogh. Our guide for this tour is a lively hamster who&#x2015;also chameleon-like&#x2015;sports a Dali mustache on one spread, a Van Gogh ear bandage on the next. &nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What would your snowman look like?&#x201d; the book asks, and then offers a page with a picture frame for a child to fill in. Backmatter thumbnail biographies of the artists complete this highly original tour of the creative imagination that will delight adults as well as children.</p> Fountas &amp; Pinnell Level O Full Color</p><p><p>AMY NEWBOLD conceived <strong>IF PICASSO PAINTED A SNOWMAN</strong> book while visiting the Mus�e Picasso in Paris. If she were to draw a snowman, she would probably start with three white circles stacked one upon another...or maybe just two. Now she's back with <strong>IF DA VINCI PAINTED A DINOSAUR</strong> and <strong>IF MONET PAINTED A MONSTER.</strong></p><p>Award-winning illustrator GREG NEWBOLD grew up drawing superheroes and Dr. Seuss characters on giant rolls of newsprint in his childhood basement. He once copied a Vincent van Gogh painting for his college art history class instead of writing a paper. Greg has created work for clients such as Kleenex, Fedex, Heinz, Smucker&#x2019;s, and American Express as well as illustrating a dozen books for children, including&nbsp; <strong><em>If Da Vinci Painted a Dinosaur,</em></strong><em><strong>If Picasso Painted a Snowman</strong>, The Barnyard Night Before Christmas, The Touch of the Master&#x2019;s Hand, Winter Lullaby</em>, and <em>Spring Song</em>. Greg lives in Salt Lake City with his wife, Amy.</p>&#x201c;<strong>With big, brightly colored original illustrations that range from evocative to downright authentic-looking, the Newbolds introduce 17 &#x201c;modern&#x201d; (more or less) painters by suggesting how each might have depicted a snowman.</strong> A smiling hamster wielding a paintbrush conducts viewers through a gallery that begins with a cubist &#x201c;Picasso,&#x201d; looks back to a vague shape in a Turneresque blizzard, and then darts in no particular order from Lichtenstein and O&#x2019;Keeffe to Klimt, Pollock, Van Gogh (where the hamster acquires a bandage on its ear), Sonia Delaunay, and, finally, Grant Wood, with a version of American Gothic. Captions identify each artist, and appended biographical sketches add further information. For the most part, the artists make up a familiar roster of dead, white, male Europeans or Americans, and an inviting blank canvas at the end may prompt some would-be Picassos to draw directly on the page. Still, along with introductions to some significant figures in art history, <strong>readers will come away with clear notions of their characteristic styles, as well as visual differences between schools of art.</strong> &#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Peters, <em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c; <p>Lynn: Most of us, if asked to paint a snowman, would start with three circles, then add a few details. But Amy and Greg Newbold ask what a snowman would look like in the hands of famous painters.&nbsp;If Picasso Painted a Snowman&nbsp;(2017) is their delightful answer. A chubby little hamster takes readers through a series of snowman pictures, all painted in the styles of iconic artists, from Picasso to Jackson Pollack. Vibrant, imaginative, and playful, this charming book is an art history survey course in a picture book. Newbold has done a terrific job using images and concepts kids can easily grasp to demonstrate the individual styles of 17 artists. The back matter is just as well done as the illustrations. Short biographies of each artist focus&nbsp;on their style. Greg Newbold&#x2019;s Advice for Artists adds three wonderful tips for young aspiring artists.&nbsp; And a&nbsp;section called &#x201c;Meet the Artists&#x201d; notes that none featured in the book actually painted a snowman. I loved all the illustrations here, so choosing a favorite would be almost impossible. I&#x2019;m currently wavering between Gustav Klimt&#x2019;s and Van Gogh&#x2019;s examples. How about you?</p><p>Cindy:&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#x2019;t know, Lynn. I like your choices a lot, but Roy Lichtenstein&#x2019;s comic snowman sure packs a wallop. BLAM! As I write my part of this post on a particularly difficult morning, I feel a lot like the surreal snowmen in the Salvador Dali version. Here&#x2019;s how Amy describes their riff on melting clocks in Dali&#x2019;s famous painting The Persistence of Memory: In Salvador Dali&#x2019;s winter fantasy, snowmen drip like melty cheese. The hamster&#x2019;s Dali-esque curved mustache is the piece de r�sistance! (And just one example of rodent humor on display.) My very favorite spread, though, might be one with a blank canvas propped on an easel with an encouragement to copy the page and make your own snowman. <strong>This is a ready-made&nbsp;art lesson for readers of any age. I want to get out my paints and create my own. Kids will, too. This book is sure to sell in art museum gift shops, but make sure your library or classroom or child or grandchild has one too...and some art supplies!</strong></p> &#x201d;<br> - <strong>Cindy Dobrez and Lynn Rutan, <em>Booklist Reader</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book was such a treat! Not only did it have an example of how Picasso may have depicted a snowman, it also had examples of how many other well-known artists such as Van Gogh and Monet would have painted their snowmen as well. If you&#x2019;re a fan of the arts, or have seen many famous paintings, the beautiful illustrations in this book will certainly look familiar to you. This is a great book to introduce kids to the different styles of various famous artists. It&#x2019;s perfect for little aspiring artists, and a treat for older ones!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Shifa, <em>Children's Book Council Staff Picks</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c; <p>There are short ones and tall ones and fat ones and skinny ones.&nbsp; All sorts of items, natural and man-made are added to further distinguish their physical characteristics. Just as there are no two snowflakes alike, there are no two snowwomen, snowmen, snow children or snow creatures alike.&nbsp; Each one is as unique as its maker.</p><p>An exploratory adventure begins when an unseen narrator says: But if Pablo Picasso&nbsp; painted a snowman it&nbsp; would look like . . . A page turn reveals the rather satisfied hamster holding a paint brush covered in red paint with a tube of red paint spilling out next to him.&nbsp; On the opposite page is a snowman portrayed in the style known as Cubism.&nbsp; Elements are rearranged and removed.&nbsp; Excitement follows page by page. Within a murky haze we are asked to find a single snowman.&nbsp; A superhero snowman comic-book style swings a fist as a loud BLAM! in red letters explodes on the canvas.&nbsp; A stark desert landscape hosts a snowman with a skull and antlers for a head and a lush floral array in its center.&nbsp; Can you identify the three artists?</p><p>A brightly colored quilt wraps around a snow family.&nbsp; Haystacks stand with snowmen like sentries.&nbsp; Pablita Velarde's birds keep company with her snowman.&nbsp; Is there a snowman hidden in the Jackson Pollack splatters?&nbsp; No one can fail to recognize the painter who might have depicted snowmen languishing like wet noodles on an alien plain or the two snow people standing in front of buildings straight out of Americana, the one holding a shovel upright.&nbsp; With each revelation our knowledge grows.</p><p>Artist Greg Newbold through meticulous research replicates the techniques and styles of each of the seventeen painters focusing on those most notable works.&nbsp; Some of his illustrations span a single page, edge to edge.&nbsp; Others appear as a large portion of an artist's canvas.&nbsp; Several cover two pages crossing the gutter.&nbsp; Two are placed playfully with overlapping corners, as if waiting to be hung on a wall.</p><p>Art educators and those interested in art are going to be thrilled with&nbsp;<strong>If Picasso Painted a Snowman</strong> written by Amy Newbold with illustrations by Greg Newbold.&nbsp; In fact, even those who don't believe they like art will enjoy this book. The premise of using a snowman, in which most can identify, to present the artists is a marvelous idea.&nbsp; On the final two pages, the hamster invites you to paint your own picture on a page showing a blank easel you can replicate. The next six pages give more information about the artists.&nbsp; As a final note Greg gives artists three key points of advice.&nbsp; &nbsp;It might be fun to ask students to research other artists and create snowmen as they would.&nbsp; If you are doing a Mock Caldecott unit, you might feature snowmen as drawn by Caldecott artists.&nbsp; This title would be a welcome addition in your professional and personal book collections.</p> &#x201d;<br> - <strong>Xena's Mom, <em>Librarian's Quest</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;... This a wonderful book! Many of the readers of MC have kids or are aunts and uncles. This book is for you and yours. It is a great introduction to a large variety of artists and their work, but also opens up the imagination to all the possibilities of different artists paint, but also how different thinkers might approach the same challenge.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Howard Lyon, <em>Muddycolors.blogspot</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c; <p>The Newbolds use the example of a snowman to drive home the idea that &#x201c;not all artists paint the same.&#x201d; With a cherubic hamster as guide, who wields paintbrushes and mugs for readers, Amy Newbold imagines how 17 famous artists might have painted a snowman, giving her husband a chance to try out each artist&#x2019;s style. A large snowman cuddles two smaller ones, all wrapped up in a quilted blanket, in a Klimt-inspired spread; in a remake of Dal�&#x2019;s The Persistence of Memory, flattened snowmen replace drooping clocks. Newbold keeps the text short and punchy (&#x201c;Blam! Roy Lichtenstein&#x2019;s snow hero saves the day!&#x201d;), and she covers a range of artistic styles, from Monet&#x2019;s impressionism to Klee&#x2019;s abstract art and the &#x201c;flat&#x201d; images of Pueblo artist Pablita Velarde. A blank easel invites readers to contribute their own snowmen, and the book concludes with capsule biographies of the featured painters. The hamster&#x2019;s antics can be a bit much (he&#x2019;s shown with a bandage over a missing ear on the Van Gogh page), but in all it&#x2019;s <strong>an inviting introduction to a range of important painters</strong>. Ages 6&#x2013;12. (Oct.)</p> &#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c; <p>Did you ever wonder how Vincent van Gogh would paint a snowman? Or how Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe might depict the frozen subject? This book shows the reader how 17 well-known artists might illustrate this particular subject matter. The story begins with the simple way most know: draw three circles, add the eyes, triangle shaped nose, and a dotted smile. Then things become interesting. A snowman shape is incorporated into a famous artist&#x2019;s painting or one is created in his/her style. Instead of melting clocks, as in Salvador Dal�&#x2019;s painting, we see liquefied snowmen. There is a pointillism snowman in the style of Georges Seurat, and you&#x2019;ll never look at Grant Wood&#x2019;s&nbsp;American Gothic&nbsp;painting the same again. The artwork is excellent as the illustrator captures the artist&#x2019;s style perfectly. The slight amount of text is just enough to engage young readers. A small hamster is the guide throughout. He dons a beret, mustache, or a bandaged ear (a tribute to van Gogh). The hamster may not be on every page, but when he is present, he adds humor. The end of the book includes information about the artists named and a bit about their individual styles of art.&nbsp;</p><p>VERDICT&nbsp;<strong>An excellent way to introduce children to classic artists and their styles. It also might encourage budding artists to think outside the box and create images in their own unique style</strong></p> &#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>School Library Journal Express</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A range of art styles is explored in this picture book that invites readers to imagine how various artists would paint a snowman...The examples of the art mimic some of the artists' famous paintings but incorporate imagined snowmen into them. For example, Dali's "snowmen drip like melted cheese" in a double-page spread that emulates "The Persistence of Memory" with flattened, drooping snowmen rather than timepieces depicted on the surreal landscape...A closing spread with a blank easel nicely invites readers to copy it and make their own snowman painting.&nbsp; Endnotes provide further context about the artists...<strong>A playful introduction to various art movements...</strong>&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus</em></strong></p><h2>Escape by Night: A Civil War Adventure</h2><p><p>In <i>Escape by Night</i>, Ten-year-old Tommy and his sister Annie are intrigued by the new soldiers arriving in their Georgia town.

He rushed to the window and barked loudly.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s bothering Samson?&#x201d; Annie asked, looking up from her book.<br>Tommy pushed open the second-story window and leaned out. Samson joined him.<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a wagon coming down Telfair Street,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Samson, what do you think&#x2019;s in the wagon? Hogs?&#x201d; Tommy smiled as he imagined the hogs snorting and squealing.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more likely beans or squash,&#x201d; Annie said. She tossed her book aside and joined them.<br>The wagon rolled by, and the awful scene below left them speechless. Instead of colorful vegetables or squealing hogs, the cart overflowed with dirty, bloody Confederate soldiers. They looked like old rags that had been cast aside. A breeze carried the unmistakable stench of sickness and death up to the window.<br>&#x201c;Oh, my,&#x201d; Annie said, covering her nose and mouth.<br>Samson&#x2019;s nostrils flared.<br>&#x201c;Smells like rotten fish,&#x201d; Tommy said. &#x201c;They must be going to our church.&#x201d;<br>First Presbyterian Church, where their father was pastor, stood catty-corner to their house.

Those men were constantly moving, hoping for some relief from their pain. The only movement on this cart was one man&#x2019;s lifeless leg, which hung off the back, swinging back and forth like the pendulum of a large clock.<br>&#x201c;You think they&#x2019;re dead?&#x201d; Tommy asked.<br>&#x201c;That would explain the smell.

He won&#x2019;t miss it.&#x201d;<br>The cart slowed. The driver motioned to two soldiers standing in front of the church.

His voice reflected the pleasure he felt at his small victory over Annie.<br>&#x201c;I hate war,&#x201d; Annie said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to the cookhouse to see what&#x2019;s for lunch. Come on, Samson.&#x201d;<br>Samson stared at Annie but did not move.<br>&#x201c;Why won&#x2019;t he come?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And for that matter, why does he always sleep in your bed? I want him to sleep in mine.&#x201d;<br>Annie stared at the unmoving dog. &#x201c;All right. Stay if you like, but you&#x2019;re my dog, too.&#x201d; She left the room.<br>Tommy stared at the small, dusty book in the middle of the street.<br>&#x201c;That book must be special if the soldier carried it through the battlefields all the way to Augusta,&#x201d; he said to Samson. &#x201c;If you think we should get the book, then&nbsp;<i>bark.</i>&#x201d;<br>Samson barked.<br>&#x201c;Good boy.&#x201d; Tommy put his arm around the dog. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go outside until after lunch. Mother said so. That means if we want the book, it&#x2019;s up to you to&nbsp;<i>fetch.</i>&#x201d;<br>Samson whined.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&nbsp;<i>Fetch.</i>&#x201d;<br>Samson followed Tommy down the stairs. Tommy opened the front door.<br>&#x201c;<i>Fetch</i>&nbsp;the book.&#x201d;<br>Samson trotted down the steps and into the street. He picked up the book and returned to Tommy. They hurried to the sitting room, where Tommy inspected the cover.<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no title or author&#x2019;s name, Samson. Should I open it? I can&#x2019;t read words very well, but there might be maps inside. I can read a map.&#x201d;<br>Samson pulled at Tommy&#x2019;s arm.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter? You don&#x2019;t want me to open it?&#x201d; Tommy stared at the small leather strap that held the book closed. He wanted to tear it open, but something held him back. He rubbed the book as if to bring out its secrets.<br>&#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Tommy said. &#x201c;This might be important for the war. I should return it to its owner.&#x201d;<br>Tommy gazed out the window at First Presbyterian Church. He had gone inside only once since it had become a hospital. The bright, well-kept sanctuary was gone; in its place was a world filled with screams, groans, and pleas for help, and a heavy, overpowering smell of death.<br>&#x201c;Samson, I&#x2019;ll return it. But I&#x2019;m not going inside the church by myself. You&#x2019;ll have to go, too.&#x201d;<br>At the word &#x201c;go,&#x201d; Samson stood.<br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Tommy said. &#x201c;After lunch we&#x2019;ll find the one-armed man.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Text copyright � 2011 by Laurie Myers<br>Illustrations copyright � 2011 by Amy June Bates</p><h2>How to Keep Your Language Alive: A Commonsense Approach to One-on-One Language Learning</h2><p>Amid worldwide accounts of dying languages, author Leanne Hinton and a group of dedicated language activists are doing something about it: they have created a master-apprentice language program, a one-on-one approach that has been remarkably successful in ensuring new speakers will take the place of those, often elderly, who are fluent in an endangered language. <i>How to Keep Your Language Alive</i> is a manual for students of all languages, from Yurok to Yiddish, Washoe to Welsh; complete with exercises that can&#x2014;can and should&#x2014;be done in the most ordinary of settings, written with great simplicity and directness by a member of the linguistics faculty at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>Awash in worldwide accounts of dying languages, author Leanne Hinton and a group of dedicated language activists are doing something about it: they have created a master-apprentice language program, a one-on-one approach that has been remarkably successful in ensuring that new speakers will take the place of those, often elderly, who are fluent in endangered languages.

The first account of the gods of Irish myth to take in the whole sweep of Irish literature in both the nation&#x2019;s languages, the book describes how Ireland&#x2019;s pagan divinities were transformed into literary characters in the medieval Christian era&#x2015;and how they were recast again during the Celtic Revival of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A lively narrative of supernatural beings and their fascinating and sometimes bizarre stories, Mark Williams&#x2019;s comprehensive history traces how these gods&#x2015;known as the <i>T�atha D� Danann</i>&#x2015;have shifted shape across the centuries. We meet the Morr�gan, crow goddess of battle; the fire goddess Brigit, who moonlights as a Christian saint; the fairies who inspired J.R.R. Tolkien&#x2019;s elves; and many others. <i>Ireland&#x2019;s Immortals</i> illuminates why these mythical beings have loomed so large in the world&#x2019;s imagination for so long.</p></p><p><b>Mark Williams</b> is Fitzjames Fellow in Medieval English at Merton College, University of Oxford, and Lecturer in Celtic in the Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages.&#x201c;What is really impressive in this book is Mark Williams&#x2019;s ability to bring together modern English and medieval Irish literature....

Yet despite the devastation, this catastrophic event seems but a forgotten moment in our nation's past.<br><br>American Pandemic offers a much-needed corrective to the silence surrounding the influenza outbreak. It sheds light on the social and cultural history of Americans during the pandemic, uncovering both the causes of the nation's public amnesia and the depth of the quiet remembering that endured. Focused on the primary players in this drama--patients and their families, friends, and community, public health experts, and health care professionals--historian Nancy K. Bristow draws on multiple perspectives to highlight the complex interplay between social identity, cultural norms, memory, and the epidemic. Bristow has combed a wealth of primary sources, including letters, diaries, oral histories, memoirs, novels, newspapers, magazines, photographs, government documents, and health care literature. She shows that though the pandemic caused massive disruption in the most basic patterns of American life, influenza did not create long-term social or cultural change, serving instead to reinforce the status quo and the differences and disparities that defined American life. <br><br>As the crisis waned, the pandemic slipped from the nation's public memory. The helplessness and despair Americans had suffered during the pandemic, Bristow notes, was a story poorly suited to a nation focused on optimism and progress. For countless survivors, though, the trauma never ended, shadowing the remainder of their lives with memories of loss. This book lets us hear these long-silent voices, reclaiming an important chapter in the American past.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nancy K. Bristow</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington. She is the author of <em>Making Men Moral: Social Engineering during the Great War</em>. Bristow is the great-granddaughter of two of the pandemic's fatalities.<br><br>"A richly detailed picture of American society as it experienced an extraordinary trauma--one that shook a newly-established confidence in the efficacy of medicine and the responsiveness of civil society. Doctors, nurses, the friends and families of the sick all play a part in this carefully and imaginatively researched and lucidly written account of America's last great epidemic."--Charles Rosenberg, Harvard University<p></p><br>"Bristow has written a thoroughly researched and readable book documenting how different groups of Americans experienced and then remembered the influenza epidemic of 1918. Replete with large amounts of new information, this book is a major contribution to the historiography of both the flu and epidemic diseases more broadly."--Barron H. Lerner, author of <em>The Breast Cancer Wars</em><p></p><br>"A gifted story-teller, Bristow shows how the 1918 influenza pandemic affected Americans of all walks of life. American Pandemic is a masterful work of social and medical history that reminds why this dramatic episode matters to public health and the national imagination."--Alexandra Minna Stern, University of Michigan<p></p><br>"Well written, engaging....Recommended especially for academic readers and specialists"--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"[A]n intimate account of the individual and private sufferings of millions of Americans. Based on solid, comprehensive research, the volume is readable and vivid in language and example...[T]he author breathes life into stories of death...An impressive and important book for students, historians, and lay readers. Highly recommended."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Now among the best of the post-Second World War publications on the great pandemic of the First World War."--<em>Journal of the History of Medicine</em><p></p><br>"This readable and compelling account explains the role of race, gender and class, promotion of physical fitness and public education, and America's public health strategy during the influenza epidemics in 1918, 1919, 1920, and 1922. Bristow's work distinguishes itself with her emphasis on influenza epidemics beyond 1918-1919, the roles of physicians and nurses, the importance of public health nursing, and the personal revelation that she lost great-grandparents due to influenza."--<em>Doody's Book Reviews</em><p></p><br>"[An] excellent social and cultural history of the outbreak...Bristow expertly delves into the tragedy and seeks to reconcile the 'public amnesia' of the nation with the private remembering of individuals and their families...The result is another fine addition to the recent scholarship of this important event in American history."--<em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"Building on Alfred Crosby's ground-breaking study, as well as an incredible amount of original research, this work on the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic offers a personal, professional, and official account of how Americans came to grips with la grippe, while also reflecting on how the nation's collective memory has been shaped by ignoring this tragedy. A rewarding read and highly recommended."--<em>The Historian</em><p></p><br>"A prodigiously researched and often affecting history."--<em>Journal of Social History</em><p></p><br>"Bristow interprets these often heartbreaking stories and the shocking statistics that accompany them with sensitivity but without sensationalism. The writing is fluid and compelling."--<em>H-SHGAPE</em><p></p><br>"An intense and compelling overview of the impact that this pandemic had on Americans from every walk of life...Meticulously researched and eminently readable."--<em>History in Review</em><p></p><br>"As historian Nancy K. Bristow shows in her compelling and readable new contribution to influenza scholarship, we still do not appreciate the epidemic's many legacies...Bristow's accomplishments are manifold. She segues readily between personal stories and collective experience. She develops complexity, contingency, and a multiplicity of contexts, and she does so with precision and grace. Her research is prodigious, and her writing is accessible, <br>jargon free, and economical. At just under two hundred pages of text, <em>American Pandemic</em> will appeal to undergraduates, who will love reading it, and to instructors, who will love teaching it. This fine book stands on its own as a tribute to the rich and tragic legacies that the 1918 pandemic left behind."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Change Leadership: A Practical Guide to Transforming Our Schools</h2><p>The Change Leadership Group at the Harvard School of Education has, through its work with educators, developed a thoughtful approach to the transformation of schools in the face of increasing demands for accountability.

It attempts to tie together the biblical story of Cain and Abel; the unsolved murder of a man whose son created Superman; and the attempts by Cal Harper, a modern-day former police officer, to solve a mystery involving his estranged father and a deadly organization called the Leadership. Helping things along considerably is the talent of narrator Scott Brick, who gives an uncharacteristically animated performance filled with raw emotions and taut pacing. Brick captures the book&#39;s intense mood during long narrative passages, employing an insistent forcefulness, seemingly without taking a breath. He&#39;s not specific with character voices, but he does just enough to keep the story moving. The story is complicated but engrossing, and well worth one&#39;s time.

She began an investigative journey that took her to research labs, university food science departments, and factories around the country. What she discovered provides a rare, eye-opening&#x2014;and sometimes disturbing&#x2014;account of what we&#x2019;re really eating. Warner looks at how decades of food science have resulted in the cheapest, most abundant, most addictive, and most nutritionally inferior food in the world, and she uncovers startling evidence about the profound health implications of the packaged and fast foods that we eat on a daily basis.<br> <br>Combining meticulous research, vivid writing, and cultural analysis, Warner blows the lid off the largely undocumented&#x2014;and lightly regulated&#x2014;world of chemically treated and processed foods and lays bare the potential price we may pay for consuming even so-called healthy foods.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Melanie Warner</b></p> <p><strong>Q. What inspired you to want to explore the subject of processed foods? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong> The idea for a book crystallized for me not long after I began writing about the food and beverage industries in the mid-2000s. I went to a trade show called IFT (Institute of Food Technologists), one of the food industry&#x2019;s largest gatherings. Inside a massive convention center, there were people selling things like micro-particulated whey protein, inner pea fiber and starches that had been modified to mimic fat or dietary fiber. Companies talked about food as an &#x201c;application,&#x201d; as if it was a piece of software you put together. It seemed to me that our food had become vastly more technical and complicated than we realized, and we had little idea about what happens to it after it leaves the farm. This was the story I wanted to tell. Because in order to make good food choices, we first need to know what we&#x2019;re eating. </p> <p><strong>Q. What should everyone know about processed foods? </strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> Processed food represents an entirely new way of eating for us as human beings. Our diets have changed more in the last 100 years than they have in the last 10,000. So much of what we see in the middle aisles at grocery stores and on fast food menu boards simply didn&#x2019;t exist a century ago.</p> <p>This is a concern because, while the technology for processing food has advanced by leaps and bounds, our human biology hasn&#x2019;t. The way our bodies handle food is stuck somewhere in the Stone Age, long before there was sugary boxed cereal, chicken nuggets and frozen dinners. Much of what we eat is now deeply out of synch with our biology.</p> <p><strong>Q. What surprised you the most in your research?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> Where vitamins come from (many of them come from China and are derived from starting ingredients like sheep grease) and how prevalent soybean oil is in our diets (10% of total calories) and the health implications of that.</p> <p><strong>Q. How has your behavior changed since writing the book? Do you eat differently? Do you feed your children differently?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> Although I generally follow my own advice &#x2013; a diet with fresh, real foods at its foundation &#x2013; I do eat processed foods, as do my kids. But the book has made me a little more careful of my choices. When you stare at ingredient lists long enough, the siren call of quick, convenient, indulgent food often goes on mute. I have to say that I am no longer tempted by donuts! I also stopped my occasional purchase of fast food French fries because of what I uncovered about the toxic compounds formed in heated frying oil. And I realized there we certain things I was buying prepackaged that could in fact be made relatively easily at home, like homemade mac and cheese for the kids, made with real cheese instead of the powdered stuff in the box.</p>Melanie Warner is a freelance writer for various publications, including&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i> and&nbsp;<i>Fast Company</i>.

A star athlete and class valedictorian, tall, lanky Johnny had a future filled with promise--until he stepped into a car on prom night, dazzling in his rented tux, and in an instant, it was all taken away.<br><br> In the months that follow, Johnny&#x2019;s family and high school sweetheart, Becky, struggle to put together the pieces of their shattered lives. No one is more devastated than Johnny&#x2019;s mother, Alice, whose oldest son owned her heart from the day he was born. But amid the heartache, something miraculous is about to happen to the Peterson family, something that will alter the course of each of their lives. When a sudden illness sends Alice to the hospital, a glorious vision comes to her in her dreams. There, standing before her, is Johnny himself, with that familiar twinkle in his eye, gently urging his bewildered mother to be strong for her splintered family. For Alice, seeing her marvelous lost boy is a miracle she can&#x2019;t quite believe but is more than willing to embrace. In the weeks to come, Johnny will appear in the most unlikely places, visible only to the two people who need him most: his nine-year-old brother, locked in a silent world, whose special needs Johnny always seemed to understand...and his mother, who has always nurtured her family, but who now needs a guardian angel of her own.<br><br> Through a season of hope and healing, Johnny will walk by his mother&#x2019;s side, leaving miracles in his wake, leading his parents, his girlfriend, his sister, and his brother out of their grief. But as Alice is about to discover, Johnny has returned not just to help those he loves, but to uncover a purpose even he cannot comprehend--one that will change them all forever. <br><br> An unforgettable story of loving and letting go, of mixed blessings and second chances, <b>Johnny Angel</b> is a celebration of life, hope, and forgiveness. It will make you laugh and cry...and hold your loved ones just a little bit closer.</p><p><b>Danielle Steel</b>&nbsp;has been hailed as one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors, with over 650 million copies of her novels sold.

The sophistication of Los Angeles and Hollywood seemed light-years from here. The city was just far enough so as to seem not to exist at all, and kids could still be kids on a warm summer day. School was drawing to a close before summer vacation, graduation was about to fall like a ripe plum into the seniors' hands, and the prom was only days away.<br><br>Johnny Peterson was the valedictorian of the senior class, and the star of both the track and the football teams for the past four years. He and Becky Adams had been going out for four years. They were standing on the school steps, talking to a group of friends, his tall lanky body swaying ever so slightly in her direction, as their eyes met from time to time. They shared the same barely guarded secret that many of the kids their age did. They were in love with each other, had been sleeping with each other for the past year, and had been seeing each other exclusively before that for all of their high school years. High school sweethearts, with vague but unspoken plans to wind up together one day. Johnny was about to turn eighteen in July, before starting college. Becky had turned eighteen in May.<br><br>His dark brown hair shone in the summer sunshine, with copper lights that seemed to be reflected in his dark brown eyes. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and athletic, had great teeth and a perfect smile. He looked the way every young man wished he could as a high school senior, but few do. But more than that, he was a terrific kid, and a nice guy. He had always been a good student, had lots of friends, and had two jobs when he wasn't playing sports and on weekends. His parents had very little money with three kids to support, and often just managed to get by. But they always did. He would have liked to play pro football and could have, but he had very sensibly decided to go to state college on a scholarship, and study accounting, so he could help his dad. His dad ran a small accounting firm, and had never much liked what he did. But Johnny didn't seem to mind it, and was a whiz in math. And his excellent computer skills were a huge help too. His mom had been a nurse and had retired years before, to take care of his younger brother and sister, which had turned out to be a full-time job, especially in the past five years. Charlotte, his little sister, had just turned fourteen and was starting high school in the fall. And Bobby, who was nine, was a special child.<br><br>Becky's family was not as orderly as Johnny's. She had four brothers and sisters, and their life had pretty much fallen apart two years before, when her dad died. He was a construction worker, and was killed in a freak accident. It left the family financially desperate and stunned. Becky had two jobs after school, and worked hard. They needed every penny she and her oldest brother could earn. And unlike Johnny, her scholarship hadn't come through. She was going to work full time at the drugstore all year, and try again for a scholarship next year. And she didn't really mind. She wasn't the student Johnny was, and she was relieved to have a break from school. She liked working, loved her two sisters and two brothers, and was happy to help her mom in whatever way she could. They had gotten pitifully little money from her dad's insurance, and things had been tough for a long time. Johnny was the sweet spot in her life.<br><br>Her hair was as fair as his was dark, her eyes as blue as the summer sky. She was a pretty girl, and she loved him.<br><br>She worried a little about his going to college and meeting other girls, but she knew he loved her. Everyone in their class said they were the perfect couple, they were always together, always laughing, talking, joking, happy, and they never seemed to fight. As much as they were boyfriend and girlfriend, they were also best friends. And because of that, Becky had fewer friends than she might have otherwise. She and Johnny spent every minute together they could. They went to class together, and saw each other at night, whenever possible, after sports, homework, and jobs. And they were both so conscientious, their parents no longer complained about how much they saw each other. They were rarely apart.<br><br>And as they stood at the center of a cluster of high school seniors, everyone was talking about graduation and prom. They had kept it a secret between them, but Johnny had paid for her dress. Without his help, she couldn't have gone. And she smiled up at him now, four years of love and confidences and secrets between them, and her eyes seemed to light up like fireworks when she looked at him.<br><br>"I've got to get going, you guys. I have to get to work," Johnny said, smiling at his friends. He worked at a nearby lumber company, taking inventory, sorting stock, and sawing wood. And he made good money for hard work. Becky was already working at the drugstore job that was about to become full time for her, and had just given up her second job waitressing in a coffee shop near school. It was going to be a lot easier for her now working in just one place. Johnny worked for his father on weekends, and the lumber supply company after practice and games. He was going to work for them full time all summer, to make as much money as he could before school. "Come on, Becky," he tugged at her arm, to pull her away from the girls who were still talking about what they were wearing to the prom that was two days away. For most of them, it was the end of an era, the culmination of a dream. And it was for Becky and Johnny too. But they had had none of the stress and panic of some of the others, wondering who to take as their dates. Their relationship gave them both confidence, and an unusual amount of emotional support. High school had been easier for them because of that.<br><br>Becky finally managed to tear herself away from their friends, and tossed her long blond hair over her shoulder as she followed Johnny to his car. He was carrying both their backpacks, and threw them easily into the backseat as he glanced at his watch. "Do you want to pick up the kids?" He tried to do that with her as often as he could. He was one of those people who enjoyed helping people out, and often did.<br><br>"Do you have time?" she asked comfortably. In some ways, they already seemed married, and in their heart of hearts they knew that they would be one day. It was another of the unspoken secrets they shared. They were so close, had grown up together, and sometimes it seemed like they didn't even need words.<br><br>"Sure, I've got time," he smiled at her, as she slid into her seat, and turned on the radio. They liked the same music, the same people, the same food. She loved watching him play football, he loved dancing with her, and talking to her for hours on the phone, after work. Most nights, he dropped by her house on his way home. And then he'd call her when he finished his homework. His mother said they were like Siamese twins.<br><br>The school where her younger siblings went was only four blocks away, and all four of them were hanging out in the schoolyard when they got there and Becky waved. The four Adams kids came thundering toward them, and as Becky leaned forward to let them in, they piled unceremoniously into the back of the car.<br><br>"Hi, Johnny," both boys said in unison, and Peter, the oldest one, at twelve, thanked him for the ride. They were nice, wholesome kids. Mark was eleven, Rachel was ten, and Sandi was seven. Theirs was a noisy, loving, lively house, and two years after he had died, they all still missed their dad. All their mom had done in the past two years was chase after them, and work too hard. She looked ten years older than she had when Mike had died. And although her friends kept telling her she should start dating, she just looked at them as though they were crazy, and told them she had no time. But it was more than that, and Becky knew it. Her mom had never loved anyone except her dad, and couldn't bear the thought of going out with another man. They had been high school sweethearts too.<br><br>Johnny dropped off Becky and the kids, she kissed him lightly before she got out, and he waved at all of them as he drove away. And as he disappeared down the street at full speed, she shepherded the others into the house, and helped them to get snacks and drinks, before leaving for work. She knew her mom would be home from her job in two hours. She ran the local beauty school. She was a pretty woman, life just hadn't turned out the way she'd dreamed. She had never expected to wind up alone at forty, with five kids.<br><br>Johnny was back at Becky's front door again four hours later, looking tired and happy. He stayed long enough to eat a sandwich with her at the kitchen table, chat with her mom, tease the kids, and head home by nine-thirty. His days were long and full.<br><br>"I can't believe it's almost graduation, seems like just last year you two were about five years old and going trick-or-treating together." Pam Adams shook her head and smiled as she watched Johnny unwind his long frame from the kitchen chair. He had played basketball in his freshman year, and been good at it, but eventually football and track had taken up all his time. Pam looked at Johnny gratefully, he was such a nice kid. She hoped he and Becky would get married one day, and that he would live a longer life than her husband had. But the years she'd shared with Mike had been so very good, she didn't regret an instant of them, just the fact that he was gone. "Thank you for getting Becky's dress for her," she said softly. She was the only one who knew. He hadn't even told his mom and dad.<br><br>"It looks great on her," Johnny said easily, slightly embarrassed by the look of gratitude in her mother's eyes. "We'll have a good time." He had ordered a corsage for her too.<br><br>"I hope so. Becky's dad and I got engaged at senior prom." She said it nostalgically, but it wasn't a hint to him. It was pretty obvious that they were heading that way too, with or without a ring.<br><br>"See you tomorrow," Johnny said as he left, and Becky followed him outside. They stood next to his car for a few minutes, chatting, and he took her in his arms and they kissed. It was a kiss filled with passion, emotion, all the feelings they shared, and the energy of youth, and she was breathless when they stopped.<br><br>"You'd better go before I drag you into the bushes, Johnny Peterson," she said with a giggle, and the smile that still tore his heart out after all these years.<br><br>"That sounds pretty good. Your mom might get a little upset," he teased. None of their parents knew, or so they thought, how far things had gone, although unbeknownst to them, both their mothers were well aware of it. Pam had had a talk with Becky once, and urged her to be careful. But they both were. They were both sensible kids and, so far at least, had had no slip-ups and no scares. Becky had no intention of getting pregnant before they got married, and that was still years away. Johnny had to finish school, and so did she, and she wasn't even starting for another year. They were in no hurry, they had all the time in the world. "I'll call you later," he promised, as he got into his car. He knew his mother would be waiting for him, most likely with something to eat, even though he'd eaten at Becky's house. And with no homework to do, he might spend some time with the kids and his dad. Depending on how things were when he got home.<br><br>He lived only two miles from Becky's house, and he was home five minutes later. He parked in the driveway behind his dad's car, and as he walked through the backyard he saw his younger sister Charlotte shooting baskets by herself, the way he used to do. She looked just like their mother, and a little like Becky, with big blue eyes and long blond hair. She was wearing shorts and a tank top, and her legs were nearly as long as his. She was tall for her age, and beautiful, but she didn't really care. The only thing that interested Charlotte was sports. She ate, slept, dreamed, and talked about nothing but baseball in the summer, football and basketball in the winter, and she played on every team she could. She was the most perfect all-around athlete, male or female, Johnny had ever known.<br><br>"Hi Charlie, how's it going?" he said, as he caught the ball she tossed at him. It always made him smile because she threw like a guy. She had a remarkable talent for sports.<br><br>"Okay," she glanced over her shoulder at him after he threw the ball back to her, and she sank another basket. And he could see, when she looked at him, that her eyes were sad.<br><br>"What's up?" He put an arm around her, and she stopped for a minute, and leaned against him. He could feel the sadness emanating through her. In the last few years, she seemed older than she was, in part because she was tall. But she was also wise beyond her years.<br><br>"Nothing."<br><br>"Is Dad home?" But he knew he was, by the car. Johnny knew what was bothering her. It wasn't new to either of them, but it still hurt, after all these years.<br><br>"Yeah." She nodded, and then started to dribble the ball, as Johnny watched her for a minute, and then grabbed the ball from her. They played together for a few minutes, taking turns sinking baskets, and it struck him again how good she was. It was a shame in some ways that she wasn't a boy. And he knew she thought so too. She had gone to almost every game he'd played through all his high school years, and rooted passionately for him. Johnny was exactly who she wished she could be. He was her hero, more than anyone on earth.</p><h2>Death Wears a Beauty Mask and Other Stories</h2><p>A one-of-a-kind mystery collection that showcases the immense storytelling talent #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Mary Higgins Clark has honed over her tremendous career&#x2014;including a bone-chilling, previously unpublished short story forty years in the making.<br><br>In 1974, master storyteller Mary Higgins Clark began writing a novella inspired by the dark side of the New York City fashion world.

Then, one day, he wakes with an awful, unreachable itch. He could use a scratch from a friend, but he stinks so much that no one will help! Will Big Smelly Bear change his ways and bathe? Kids will love this lighthearted tale about keeping clean-and really relate to the bath-resistant adorable hero.</p><p>Britta Teckentrup was born in Hamburg, Germany, and later studied at St. Martin&#39;s College of Art and the Royal College of Art in London. An internationally published author and illustrator, Britta now lives and works in Berlin, Germany with her artist husband and young son.Teckentrup's (<i>Kancil and the Crocodiles</i>) determinedly dirty and deliciously rendered hero looks a lot like a mucky soccer field to which paws, ears and a snout have been added. His name is no exaggeration&#x2014;he smells so bad that flies "were the only ones that ever came close." What finally gets him to come clean? A bad itch he can't reach and a cutie named Big Fluffy Bear, who offers to scratch his back if he'll take a bath first (she makes this offer while perched in a tree, safely out of range of the stink). The two bears quibble and Big Smelly Bear acquiesces grumpily (the interplay will undoubtedly remind some readers of exchanges between parent and child) but it's clearly the beginning of a beautiful friendship. While its subject matter is grubby, this is one handsome book. Teckentrup creates strikingly graphic spreads from simple, large-scale shapes and expressionistic overlays of texture and color. The combination of the blunt text and bold pictures might even help cajole reluctant bathers to get their feet wet.

And as Tamim Ansary shows in this illuminating history, every intervention has come to grief in much the same way and for much the same reason: The intervening power has failed to understand that Afghanistan has a story of its own, a story that continues to unfold between, and despite, the interventions. <br><br><i>Games without Rules</i> tells this story from the inside looking out. Drawing on his Afghan background, Muslim roots, and Western and Afghan sources, Ansary weaves an epic that moves from a universe of village republics--the old Afghanistan--through a tumultuous drama of tribes, factions, and forces, to the current struggle. <br><br>Ansary paints a richly textured portrait of a nation that began to form around the same time as the United States but is still struggling to coalesce; a nation driven by its high ambitions but undermined by its own demons, while every forty to sixty years a great power crashes in and disrupts whatever progress has been made. A compelling narrative told in an accessible, conversational style, <i>Games without Rules</i> offers revelatory insight into a country long at the center of international debate, but never fully understood by the outside world.</p><p><p><b>Tamim Ansary</b> is the author of <i>Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World through Islamic Eyes</i> and <i>West of Kabul, East of New York</i>, among other books.

This insider's perspective fills large gaps in contemporary outsiders' understandings of why these powers have failed and hopefully points the way towards forms of international cooperation that will work for Afghanistan rather than against it. Ansary has a gift for using informal language to illustrate his points in a way that doesn't compromise the legitimacy of his narrative. His ability to contextualize the history and situate it in culture, as well as to remind readers of when to keep track of important figures (sometimes for decades) is refreshing. Ansary has produced an invaluable resource to those curious about this tumultuous region. <br><b><i>Geographical Magazine</i></b> As an Afghan-American, Tamim Ansary is well placed to present the Western reader with a penetrating view of his complex and often baffling native land. With the 2014 draw-down of NATO combat forces from Afghanistan approaching a better-late-than-never understanding of how the country works and its history is crucial if we re to avoid the mistakes of the past. <br><b><i>New Statesman</i></b> (Ansary s) is an authentically Afghan voice, offering not an authoritative account of the ebb and flow of foreign entanglement in Afghanistan but a personal account of how an intelligent Afghan observer sees the course of events from the outside. <b><i> <br>Irish Times</i></b> Ansary has that rare gift of being able to blend an academic s knowledge with the skill of a natural storyteller. He if Afghanistan-born, and although he left when he was just 16, in 1964, he has clearly spent a lifetime collecting stories, which he has edited masterfully, knowing exactly when to move away from the major events and focus on the tiny details that give you a sense of what life must have been like for the country s many poor villagers, who often had no idea what was happening in their capital city. Refreshingly he keeps his focus on Afghans, with the foreigners appearing for brief periods, usually offering little and understanding less.

You can&#x2019;t tell people stories like that without giving them ideas.</p><p>Like, That&#x2019;s really fucked up.</p><p>Or, What were you even doing there?</p><p>Or, Maybe you&#x2019;re just like them.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>&#x201c;End of the ,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Last house on the left.&#x201d;</p><p>Dad pulls our Subaru around the corner, past a wooden sign that reads FLYING EAGLE ESTATES. I press my face against the car window. Identical brick mini mansions spiral off in every direction, all surrounded by lush green grass and towering pine trees. When I was little, I used to think Madison&#x2019;s neighborhood looked like something out of a fairy tale. We&#x2019;d spend hours darting across the pristine lawns and hiding behind gnarled old oak trees, pretending to be warrior princesses.</p><p>&#x201c;I remember where Madison lives, Casey,&#x201d; Dad says. &#x201c;You used to spend every weekend here.&#x201d;</p><p>I twirl the turtle charm on my necklace. I got it because of my last name, Myrtle, and also because I was going to study them back when I was planning on being a marine biologist. But marine biology means college, so who knows anymore. &#x201c;You excited to see your friends?&#x201d; Dad asks.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; I stretch the word into two syllables. How excited can you be to see &#x201c;parent-approved&#x201d; friends? I mean, really? Dad shoots me a look. &#x201c;I am,&#x201d; I add, flashing my &#x201c;normal teenage girl&#x201d; smile. &#x201c;Really.&#x201d;</p><p>Dad nods, but he doesn&#x2019;t look convinced. We have the same face: long, straight nose, stubby chin. We even have the same dark eyes and thick brows that tell the world exactly what we&#x2019;re thinking at every moment. Right now, his brows pinch in at the middle, creating tiny worry lines on his forehead.</p><p>I flip down the sun visor and scrutinize my reflection. Pale skin, circles under my eyes, and a fresh zit coming in on my forehead. I should have insisted on a post-rehab makeover.</p><p>I push my hair back to check out the freshly shaved side of my head. At least that still looks badass. I stole my dad&#x2019;s electric razor a couple of days after getting back and buzzed my brown locks. You can&#x2019;t see it when my hair is down, but Mom freaked anyway. Which was the entire point.</p><p>I make a face at my reflection and pinch my pale cheeks. A faint burst of red appears on my skin, then disappears a second later. I sigh and flip the sun visor up.</p><p>&#x201c;Feeling okay?&#x201d; Dad asks.</p><p>Translation: Did the thousands of dollars we spent on Mountainside actually fix you?</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m good. This is pie.&#x201d; Pie&#x2019;s my word. Kind of like &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a piece of cake,&#x201d; only I used to scarf down these cherry&#x2013;cream cheese pies my dad made every weekend.</p><p>It&#x2019;s also my classic nonanswer, and I feel guilty the second it&#x2019;s out of my mouth. &#x201c;I feel stronger,&#x201d; I add.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I guess I&#x2019;m glad,&#x201d; Dad says. I reach for the air conditioner and Dad drops his hand on mine before I can pull it away. He squeezes, his eyes still on the road. I let him leave his hand there for a full three seconds before shrugging it off.</p><p>We roll up to a white house with forest-green shutters and a wraparound front porch. Madison leans against one of the columns flanking the front door, her long, tan legs stretched out before her. All my old friends and soccer teammates crowd around her, talking and laughing.</p><p>It feels stuffy in the Subaru all of a sudden. I switch the air-conditioning off and roll my window down. Dad cuts the steering wheel to the left, pulling up alongside a row of freshly planted yellow tulips. I squirm, uncomfortably, in my seat.</p><p>&#x201c;Something wrong?&#x201d; Dad asks.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I say, too fast. It&#x2019;s a scientific fact that dads don&#x2019;t understand teenage girl politics. Like how your former best friend might invite you to a sleepover just to be nice, and not because she actually wants to spend the night with the school cautionary tale.</p><p>I grab my polka-dot Herschel backpack and push the door open. The smell of tulips overwhelms me. It&#x2019;s like the way you imagine flowers smell, not how they really smell. Except these do.</p><p>Madison turns at the sound of the car door slamming. I step onto her lawn, and her face lights up.</p><p>&#x201c;Casey!&#x201d; she squeals. &#x201c;You came!&#x201d;</p><p>She hands her lemonade glass to the girl standing next to her and races across the sloped lawn toward me. Watching her, I feel a phantom twinge of pain in my knee, the injury that started this all. Madison throws her arms around my shoulders, and suddenly all I can see is tan skin and blond hair. She squeezes too tightly, giving me the feeling this hug is more for the girls on the porch and my dad than it is for me. I rock back on my heels.</p><p>&#x201c;Oof,&#x201d; I groan. She&#x2019;s not much larger than me, but she works out six times a week and never eats junk food. Her body is all muscle. Life is a contact sport for Madison.</p><p>Dad unrolls the car window. &#x201c;Madison, it&#x2019;s nice to see you again,&#x201d; he says. Madison releases me from her strangle-hug. She&#x2019;s already wearing a pair of polka-dot pajama shorts and a loose-fitting T-shirt. He turns back to me and his eyebrows do the furrowing, worry-line thing again. &#x201c;You have your cell, right? You&#x2019;ll call me if you need&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anything,&#x201d; I finish for him. &#x201c;I know. I will.&#x201d;</p><p>Dad stares at me for a beat too long, a nervous smile on his face. I should feel guilty about that smile. But I&#x2019;m so tired of everyone looking at me like I&#x2019;m a bomb about to go off.</p><p>I already went off. I&#x2019;m better now.</p><p>Dad rolls his window up, waving one last time as he steers the car away from the curb. I wiggle my fingers at his taillights, halfheartedly.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s lemonade on the porch,&#x201d; Madison says, looping her arm around my shoulder. &#x201c;And hummus and stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>She winds her thick blond braid around her finger. The gold &#x201c;best friends&#x201d; bracelet I gave her back in sixth grade dangles from her wrist. Something about it makes me sad. Like the strangle-hug made me sad. She&#x2019;s trying too hard to remind me that we&#x2019;re friends.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have Funfetti icing?&#x201d; I ask, looking away from the bracelet. Funfetti was practically a fifth food group our freshman year.</p><p>&#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; Madison says, and flicks the pendant on her bracelet. &#x201c;Is it weird being back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s pie.&#x201d; I smooth my hair over the shaved side of my head. Shana said my old haircut didn&#x2019;t match my personality, but Madison wouldn&#x2019;t understand. She hasn&#x2019;t changed her hair since elementary school. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing good. Great, actually.&#x201d; I stop walking and lower my voice so the girls on the porch don&#x2019;t overhear me. &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;m not really a drug addict. My parents overacted. They thought I was, like, shooting heroin into my eyeballs or something.&#x201d; I laugh, but it&#x2019;s stilted and awkward. Madison stares at me, frowning.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; I continue, clearing my throat. &#x201c;I just had a bad reaction to my painkillers.&#x201d; At least, I think I had a bad reaction to my painkillers. The night I went to rehab is a blank spot on my memory. I don&#x2019;t remember anything that happened, but Shana told me I passed out, and she said it could have been the pain meds, which is good enough for me. Apparently it happens all the time.</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t anything like the girls there,&#x201d; I finish, thinking of Rachel and Moira and Tori Anne.</p><p>Madison wrinkles her nose. She looks skeptical. &#x201c;Painkillers can be addictive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hence the rehab,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;And they were prescription, anyway.&#x201d; My doctor prescribed oxycodone after a girl the size of a Clydesdale slammed into me during a soccer game last year, ruining my knee. &#x201c;My parents just flipped because I passed out, but my doctor said lots of people have bad reactions. It wasn&#x2019;t a big deal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;m not even eating white flour anymore,&#x201d; Madison says. &#x201c;I read this article that says it&#x2019;s basically as addictive as cocaine.&#x201d;</p><p>I tug on my Myrtle necklace. What are you supposed to say to a girl who doesn&#x2019;t eat bread? That&#x2019;s not even human.</p><p>&#x201c;Is there rehab for pasta?&#x201d; I ask. Madison laughs too loudly for my stupid joke and takes the steps to the porch two at a time.</p><p>All the girls are already dressed in their pajamas, except for Stacy Donovan, who&#x2019;s wearing Nike athletic shorts and a neon blue sports bra. I&#x2019;m pretty sure she was born wearing athletic shorts and a sports bra. She smiles at me when I step onto the porch.</p><p>&#x201c;Cute jeans!&#x201d; she calls.</p><p>&#x201c;Um, thanks,&#x201d; I say. A pair of tight, dark-wash jeans with a ripped knee hangs low on my hips, accentuating my long legs and thin waist. I spent all afternoon trying on everything in my closet, and I finally landed on my best jeans and a slouchy black T-shirt.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you want to get changed?&#x201d; Madison asks. I glance down at my backpack. I brought my matching pj&#x2019;s with the giant strawberries on them, like I&#x2019;m twelve.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m good for now.&#x201d; I dump my backpack on the ground and take the glass of lemonade Madison offers me.</p><p>Kiki Charles waves from the porch swing, where she&#x2019;s sitting with Amanda Rice and a girl from the JV team I don&#x2019;t recognize. I wave back. Kiki and I used to partner up for early morning sprints, and Amanda always offered to paint my nails blue and yellow&#x2014;the team colors&#x2014;on the bus to away games. But that was all pre-injury, pre-Shana, pre-rehab. I barely saw them after I quit the team last year.</p><p>Amanda leans forward, balancing her lemonade glass on her knee. &#x201c;Please tell me you&#x2019;re taking calc this year,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Algebra 2 was horrible after you left. Mr. Nelson was up to two puns a day by the end of the year, and I had no one to groan with in the back row.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tragic,&#x201d; I say, and the corner of my mouth lifts into a smile. Talking about school is the high school girl equivalent of talking about the weather. But it&#x2019;s still better than the alternative.</p><p>&#x201c;You have no idea,&#x201d; Amanda says. &#x201c;Did you know he likes angles, but only to a certain degree? Ooh, and he kept threatening to kick Kevin Thomas out of class if he had another infraction.&#x201d; She shoots me a disgusted look over the top of her lemonade glass. &#x201c;Get it? Infraction.&#x201d;</p><p>Madison rolls her eyes. &#x201c;No one has suffered like you&#x2019;ve suffered,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>I take a drink of lemonade, grimacing as I swallow. It&#x2019;s sugar-free. &#x201c;So.&#x201d; I clear my throat, shrugging the tension from my shoulders. &#x201c;What else have I missed?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tuesday&#x2019;s now sloppy joe day in the cafeteria,&#x201d; Madison says with mock enthusiasm. &#x201c;And Sean Davenport&#x2019;s dating Clare Ryan this week, so that&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. special.&#x201d;</p><p>I frown, trying to picture our high school quarterback with Clare, the drama weirdo who wears a beret to school every day. &#x201c;What happened to Sarah?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sarah&#x2019;s a born-again Christian now,&#x201d; Kiki explains, wrinkling her nose. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a whole different drama. Oh, and Sam cut his hair. Have you seen&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so behind already,&#x201d; I say, interrupting her before she can start talking about my ex-boyfriend. Madison slips an arm over my shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;I went to junior prom with Henry Frank and he spent the entire night making out with Lisa Jones in the third-floor stairwell,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>&#x201c;Asshole.&#x201d; I tuck my hair behind my ear, flashing her a smile. I know she&#x2019;s trying to steer the conversation away from Sam, and I feel a rush of gratitude. It&#x2019;s almost like old times. Like in fifth grade when this girl in the cafeteria made fun of me for getting ketchup on my white tank top, and Madison retaliated by dumping a carton of chocolate milk over her head.</p><p>Then Amanda Rice leans forward, wrinkling her nose. &#x201c;Did you shave your head?&#x201d; she asks.</p><p>Shit. I push my fingers through my hair and touch the buzzed sides of my head. It feels like peach fuzz. &#x201c;Not exactly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you do it in rehab?&#x201d; Amanda asks. Madison shoots her a look&#x2014;her &#x201c;we talked about this&#x201d; look. Which means they must&#x2019;ve had an entire conversation about me before I even got here.</p><p>I look down at the ice melting in my lemonade glass, trying to ignore the heat climbing up the back of my neck. I imagine Madison telling them not to ask me about rehab. Madison saying they should pretend everything&#x2019;s normal. That we&#x2019;re all still friends.</p><p>&#x201c;It was just a question,&#x201d; Amanda mutters.</p><p>I smooth my hair over my ears. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t do it in rehab.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It looks, um, really different,&#x201d; Madison says in a fake cheery voice. &#x201c;But whatever, right? It&#x2019;s just hair. It&#x2019;ll grow back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; I fumble with Myrtle and look down at my shoes. You should be allowed to scream in public whenever a conversation gets really awkward. And then time could reset itself and you get a do-over.</p><p>But I can&#x2019;t scream without everyone thinking I&#x2019;m a crazy junkie, so I pinch the skin on my palm and stare at the mole in the middle of Amanda&#x2019;s forehead. She&#x2019;s still talking but her voice sounds like static. All I hear is a low buzz as she drones on.</p><p>The sound of a motor cuts through the hum. I turn to watch a rusty sky-blue Buick rumble up the street. I grin, recognizing Shana&#x2019;s car immediately. She inherited it when her grandmother got too old to drive. Her grandmother&#x2019;s CHASTITY IS FOR LOVERS sticker still decorates the back bumper, but Shana scratched out &#x201c;lovers&#x201d; with her keys and carved &#x201c;fuckers&#x201d; into the paint next to it. She left her grandmother&#x2019;s rosaries dangling from the rearview mirror but hot-glued the head of her little sister&#x2019;s My Little Pony to the car antenna.</p><p>Shana pulls up next to the curb, and the little horsey head wobbles above the car like crazy. Obnoxiously loud rock music drifts out of her cracked windows. Julie fills her cheeks with air and presses her lips against the back window. Aya sits next to her, eyes squeezed shut as she croons along with the music.</p><p>&#x201c;Oy, Case!&#x201d; Shana hollers. She honks, twice. &#x201c;Get that cute little ass down here!&#x201d;</p><p>The soccer girls go silent. Madison frowns.</p><p>&#x201c;Are they drunk?&#x201d; she asks.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I say, although they probably are. Julie fogs up the back window with her breath and draws a penis in the steam. She doubles over with laughter. I start to smile, too, then bite my lip when I see the look on Madison&#x2019;s face.</p><p>&#x201c;What are they doing here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I say. I really don&#x2019;t. I haven&#x2019;t seen Shana since getting back from rehab. She must&#x2019;ve called my house to figure out where I was.</p><p>&#x201c;Casey!&#x201d; Shana lays on her horn. Without realizing I&#x2019;m doing it, I...</p></p><h2>Sacra Pagina: The Gospel of John (Volume 4)</h2><p><p><b>Now available in paperback!</b><br>No other book of the New Testament has attracted as much attention from commentators as the Fourth Gospel.

It has stirred minds, hearts, and imaginations from Christianity&#39;s earliest days. In The Gospel of John, Francis Moloney unfolds the identifiable &#34;point of view&#34; of this unique Gospel narrative and offers readers, heirs to its rich and widely varied interpretative traditions, relevance for their lives today. Includes an updated bibliography as an appendix.?The manner in which Moloney contains the size yet incorporates major past and contemporary scholarship makes the book a valuable contribution to Johannine studies. His ability to draw the reader into the narrative is exceptional.? The Australasian Catholic Record ?Moloney?s volume on John is a masterpiece that approaches the gospel from the perspective of literary criticism, attentive to its final form as a literary work. . . . Moloney?s commentary is substantial without being overly technical; he always keeps the needs of the pastor or preacher in mind as he explains the multiple levels of meaning in the text. This volume, together with each volume in this fine series, belongs in every college, seminary, and university library.? Catholic Library World?As each passage flows by, and with each dive into the original text, the author lays the groundwork and the foundation for his explanation: that the author of the fourth Gospel had a decided point of view that he wanted to get across, and that the modern reader can get as much out of the reading as a first century Christian. It helps us to understand how and why we made the choice to believe.? Crux of the News?With all the scholarly work done on the interpretation of the Gospel of John, is there a need for another? For this book, the answer is yes.? Crux of the News&#34;This commentary deserves to be widely used by both specialists and nonspecialists.&#34; The Catholic Biblical Quarterly&#34;This commentary further testifies to Frank Moloney&#39;s position at the front rank of international Johannine scholarship. The mastery of the second literature, old and new, is clear but never intrusive. The author creatively deploys the narrative critical approach in a concise and clear exposition that successfully unfolds the theological vision of the Gospel. Scholars, pastors, theological students and all whose faith leads them to seek deeper understanding will welcome this notable addition to Sacra Pagina.&#34; Brendan Byrne, S.J. Jesuit Theological College&#34;I can strongly recommend this as the most contemporary, insightful, and useful single-volume commentary on John that I know.? Theological Studies&#34;The author is interested in facilitating the Gospel?s speaking to contemporary readers, and he is consistently successful in doing so. The importance of this work in biblical studies is that it succeeds also in practicing a narrative criticism without denigrating historical critical questions.

(She reads a chapter of <i>The Imitation of Christ</i> every night before sleep.) <i>Imitation</i> has exerted immense influence on Christian worship, ethics, and church structure, because it gives specific yet broad-minded guidance about the central task of Christian life--learning to live like Jesus. Better to read this book a little here and there, now and then, than to try gobbling it cover to cover. <i>Imitation</i> is no triumph of orderly thinking, but it's a great monument and incentive to deep living. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>When does a classic become new, fresh and extremely relevant? When someone takes it out of an outdated format and makes it readable, searchable and understandable. The Imitation of Christ has been in print for over 500 years for a good reason. It is powerful, beautiful and heart piercing. James Watkins has taken those words and reworked them into ninety daily readings, arranged by topic. Whether for daily devotions or for sound insight into a particular issue, Watkins paraphrase blends the ancient with the modern to introduce this classic to a new audience, speaking to all Christians with credibility and authority and using inclusive language not found in the original.</p><h2>Fox and the Bike Ride</h2><p><p>Fun-loving, mischievous Fox from <em>Fox and the Jumping Contest</em> is back in this charming and hilarious tale of friendship, adventure&#x2014;and snacks.</p><p>It&#x2019;s the day of the animals&#x2019; annual bike ride, and Fox is <em>not </em>excited.

He became a doctor of law at the age of 24 at the Jesuit College of Clermont, Paris, and was ordained a priest by Bishop Claude de Granier and stationed in Geneva in 1593. He became bishop of Geneva in 1602. <br><br> Francis de Sales is the author of various collections of sermons on Mary, Lent, prayer and Christmastide, as well as a work entitled <i>Set Your Heart Free</i>, edited by John Kirvan. He was known as a spiritually understanding man as well as a friend of the poor. Though known for his great intellect and theological wisdom, he spoke with simplicity and earnestness, so that all could understand. <i> An Introduction to the Devout Life </i>, his best-loved work, is based on notes he wrote for a cousin for marriage, stressing that sanctity is possible in everyday life. He died in 1622 on December 28, and was canonized by Pope Alexander VII in 1665. His feast is celebrated on January 24.<br></p><h2>Once There Was a War (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>A Penguin Classic</b><br><br>&#x201c;Age can never dull this kind of writing,&#x201d; writes the <i>Chicago Tribune </i>of John Steinbeck&#x2019;s dispatches from World War II, filed for the <i>New York Herald Tribune </i>in 1943, which vividly captured the human side of war. Writing from England in the midst of the London blitz, North Africa, and Italy, Steinbeck focuses on the people as opposed to the battles, portraying everyone from the guys in the bomber crew to Bob Hope on his USO tour. He eats and drinks with soldiers behind enemy lines, talks with them, and fights beside them.

When he shipped out as a correspondent in 1943, he was already world famous for <i>The Grapes of Wrath,</i> which had been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for literature and turned into a popular and acclaimed film. He was too old for the draft at age forty-one, and was living an enviable professional life, with publishers eager for his next novel and Hollywood as his playground. He was a celebrity. Newspapers had covered every detail of his recent divorce and remarriage, and when he decided to leave his bride in New York in order to help cover the war, that, too, was news.</p><p>So why go to war? Patriotism was part of it. Steinbeck had benefited early in his career by some of the New Deal programs for writers and artists during the Depression, and may have felt a desire to give something back, to use his talent to further the &#x201c;War Effort,&#x201d; a concept he described with typically wry insight in the introduction to this volume. But perhaps the deeper reason was the urge felt by most men in those years to &#x201c;see action,&#x201d; to play some role in, if only to witness, the sweeping historical drama of the age. The world was traumatically changing shape, and to be on the sidelines must have felt like being dealt out of the future. Recruited directly by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the novelist first contributed by writing propaganda&#x2014;perhaps the most talented hack ever pressed into such service. He wrote a novel, <i>The Moon Is Down,</i> for a precursor to the CIA, and the book <i>Bombs</i> <i>Away,</i> about a bomber crew, for the Office of War Information. But when Steinbeck pressed for work closer to the front lines, he was told he would need to be commissioned as a military officer. As if determined to prove that there is no boon too great for government bureaucracy to squander, his request to become an air force intelligence officer was scuttled by his local draft board in California, which concluded on the basis of rumor and suspicion alone that the author of <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> was sufficiently &#x201c;communistic&#x201d; to be regarded as a security risk. Thwarted, Steinbeck complained to friends at a dinner party in New York, lamenting that he would &#x201c;never see the war.&#x201d; He was promptly offered the job of correspondent for the <i>New York Herald Tribune.</i></p><p>His six-month stint produced these reports, which show that for all his acclaim as a novelist, Steinbeck had not lost his humility as a writer. His reporting shows the same extraordinary empathy for the common man that ran so deep in all his work. There is a point he makes repeatedly in these dispatches, and it is this: The closer you get to war, the less you know about what is going on. He quotes a soldier, &#x201c;I remember before I joined up I used to know everything that was happening. I knew what Turkey was doing. I even had maps with pins and I drew out campaigns with colored pencils. Now I haven&#x2019;t looked at a paper in two weeks.&#x201d; Close to action one sees only what is happening in the immediate vicinity, and in action that perspective is all one can afford.</p><p>It is a different thing, then, to be at war than to be observing and watching it from a safe distance. Steinbeck surrendered any attempt to understand the big picture, and immersed himself. Nowhere in these reports are there assessments or critiques of campaign strategy or accounts of massive troop movements. With the novelist we are simply <i>in</i> the war, swept along with millions of our countrymen. And like the others, mostly what we experience is neither thrilling nor terrible. Steinbeck understood that for most soldiers, the real experience of the war involved a lot of sitting around and waiting, often in unfamiliar and uncomfortable places, with many other men in the same boat.</p><p>In England, where forces were massed for the coming great assault on France and Germany, correspondents had already been competing for years over every scrap of news and every obvious feature story. Many journalists considered the place tapped out. Yet Steinbeck immediately found new material by focusing on things that &#x201c;serious&#x201d; journalists might regard as insignificant, and filling his accounts with workmanlike description, such as this meticulous picture of the barracks housing a Flying Fortress bomber crew: &#x201c;The room is long and narrow and unpainted. Against each side wall are iron double-decker bunks, alternating with clothes lockers. A long rack in the middle between the bunks serves as a hanger for winter coats and raincoats. Next to it is the rack of rifles and submachine guns of the crew.&#x201d; Details that would escape the eye of most reporters captured his, like the little gray dog that is &#x201c;almost a Scottie,&#x201d; who knew exactly which of the returning bombers carried his crew and would race out to greet it the moment it landed. Far more than the particulars of troop movements or the pronouncements of generals, far more than news of small victories or defeats, Steinbeck knew his readers craved stories that captured what the war looked like, how it sounded, how it smelled, how it felt. Millions of fathers, mothers, sisters, girlfriends, and wives were desperate to better understand the experience of their warriors overseas. So in each column of only eight hundred to a thousand words, Steinbeck crafted a picture in language out of the places he visited and the characters he met. He listened for the fears, joys, rumors, superstitions, and small triumphs and spun them into small stories that defined life in these long, tense months of waiting and preparation.</p></p><h2>Eastern Inferno: The Journals of a German Panzerj�ger on the Eastern Front, 1941&#x2013;43</h2><p>This book presents the remarkable personal journals of a German soldier who participated in Operation Barbarossa and subsequent battles on the Eastern Front, revealing the combat experience of the German-Russian War as seldom seen before.<br><br>Hans Roth was a member of the anti-tank (Panzerjager) battalion, 299th Infantry Division, attached to Sixth Army, as the invasion of Russia began. Writing as events transpired, he recorded the mystery and tension as the Germans deployed on the Soviet frontier in June 1941. Then a firestorm broke loose as the Wehrmacht tore across the front, forging into the primitive vastness of the East. <br><br>During the Kiev encirclement, Roth's unit was under constant attack as the Soviets desperately tried to break through the German ring. At one point, after the enemy had finally been beaten, a friend serving with the SS led him to a site where he witnessed civilians being massacred en masse (which may well have been Babi Yar). After suffering through a horrible winter against apparently endless Russian reserves, his division went on the offensive again, this time on the northern wing of "Case Gelb," the German drive toward Stalingrad.<br><br>In these journals, attacks and counterattacks are described in "you are there" detail, as Roth wrote privately, as if to keep himself sane, knowing that his honest accounts of the horrors in the East could never pass through Wehrmacht censors. When the Soviet counteroffensive of winter 1942 begins, his unit is stationed alongside the Italian 8th Army, and his observations of its collapse, as opposed to the reaction of the German troops sent to stiffen its front, are of special fascination.<br><br>Roth&#x2019;s three journals were discovered many years after his disappearance, tucked away in the home of his brother, with whom he was known to have had a deep bond. After his brother&#x2019;s death, his family discovered them and quickly sent them to Rosel, Roth&#x2019;s wife. In time, Rosel handed down the journals to Erika, Roth&#x2019;s only daughter, who had meantime immigrated to America.<br><br>Hans Roth was doubtlessly working on a fourth journal before he was reported missing in action in July 1944 during the battle known as the Destruction of Army Group Center. Although Roth&#x2019;s ultimate fate remains unknown, what he did leave behind, now finally revealed, is an incredible firsthand account of the horrific war the Germans waged in Russia.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Dedication<br>Preface<br>Foreword<br><br>Journal I:<br>Operation Barbarossa And The Battle For Kiev<br><br>Journal II:<br>March To The East And The Winter Of 1941&#x2013;42<br><br>Journal III:<br>Frontline Warfare And The Retreat After Stalingrad<br><br>Final Documents<br>Suggested Reading<br></p><p>Christine Alexander specializes in military history.<br><br>Christine Alexander and Mason Kunze are the grandchildren of Hans Roth, through whom the translation and background information of these journals has been made possible. Christine currently lives in North Carolina and Mason resides in California.&#x201c;...particularly important for two reasons. Unlike letters from the front, they were never seen by the German Army censors and so Roth was free to record his real feeling as the fighting continued. Second, because of Roth&#x2019;s untimely death in 1944 the journals weren&#x2019;t edited post-war, leaving them in their original raw state. As a result, we get a rare soldier&#x2019;s eye version of the fighting on a day-by-day basis. (<i>History of War</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;For those interested in aspects of combat on the Eastern Front (especially detailed scenes are depicted of the fighting for Kiev in 1941, Voronezh in 1942, and Orel in early 1943), the &#x2018;holocaust by bullets&#x2019; that was perpetrated in the east, and the &#x2018;daily life&#x2019; of soldiers and civilians (men and women on both counts), this is a must read.&#x201d; (<i>Kunikov&#x2019;s Reviews</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;His observations of fighting are both blunt- Everything is Scheiss- and intelligent... describes the viciousness of the fighting...&#x201d; (<i>Military Illustrated</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;..without a doubt a unique account that offers many new insights and details which the author himself may have suppressed has he survived.

Unable and unwilling to describe the horrors of the Eastern Front in his letters home to his wife, he committed them to these diary journals. He went missing in action in t he summer of 1944 and has no known grave... a harrowing yet poignant story of an ordinary soldier caught up in the worst that war can bring. There is not much in the way of technical or tactical detail and it makes for pretty grim reading at times, but it appears to portray well the day to day emotions and experiences of this dreadful conflict (<i>Miniature Wargames</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;With all the bias, rightness and wrongness of real life, and written in &#x201c;real time&#x201d;, this book accurately describes the impressions and experiences of everyday life and combat in the Russian steppes. It will not help you with your next scale model project or diorama. But it will give you a priceless insight into the people who lived and died by the equipment and groundwork that you will be modeling.<br><br>Recommended to all history aficionados and modelers.

This collection, featuring work by both senior and rising scholars, considers topics including the politics of visibility, histories of Asian American participation in women of color political formations, accountability for Asian American &#34;settler complicities&#34; and cross-racial solidarities, and Asian American community-based strategies against state violence as shaped by and tied to women of color feminisms. Asian American Feminisms and Women of Color Politics provides a deep conceptual intervention into the theoretical underpinnings of Asian American studies; ethnic studies; women&#39;s, gender, and sexual studies; as well as cultural studies in general.</p><p>Lynn Fujiwara is associate professor at the University of Oregon.

Kenner</b> spent more than ten years as a litigator in Southern California and Central Texas, using her rare free time to indulge her passion for writing. California born, she now lives&#x2014;and writes&#x2014;in Texas, with her husband and daughters.1<br><br>A cool ocean breeze caresses my bare shoulders, and I shiver, wishing I&#x2019;d taken my roommate&#x2019;s advice and brought a shawl with me tonight. I arrived in Los Angeles only four days ago, and I haven&#x2019;t yet adjusted to the concept of summer temperatures changing with the setting of the sun. In Dallas, June is hot, July is hotter, and August is hell.<br><br>Not so in California, at least not by the beach. LA Lesson Number One: Always carry a sweater if you&#x2019;ll be out after dark.<br><br>Of course, I could leave the balcony and go back inside to the party. Mingle with the millionaires. Chat up the celebrities. Gaze dutifully at the paintings. It is a gala art opening, after all, and my boss brought me here to meet and greet and charm and chat. Not to lust over the panorama that is coming alive in front of me. Bloodred clouds bursting against the pale orange sky. Blue-� gray waves shimmering with dappled gold.<br><br>I press my hands against the balcony rail and lean forward, drawn to the intense, unreachable beauty of the setting sun. I regret that I didn&#x2019;t bring the battered Nikon I&#x2019;ve had since high school. Not that it would have fit in my itty-�bitty beaded purse. And a bulky camera bag paired with a little black dress is a big, fat fashion no-�no.<br><br>But this is my very first Pacific Ocean sunset, and I&#x2019;m determined to document the moment. I pull out my iPhone and snap a picture.<br><br>&#x201c;Almost makes the paintings inside seem redundant, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I recognize the throaty, feminine voice and turn to face Evelyn Dodge, retired actress turned agent turned patron of the arts&#x2014;�and my hostess for the evening.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry. I know I must look like a giddy tourist, but we don&#x2019;t have sunsets like that in Dallas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t apologize,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I pay for that view every month when I write the mortgage check. It damn well better be spectacular.&#x201d;<br><br>I laugh, immediately more at ease.<br><br>&#x201c;Hiding out?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Carl&#x2019;s new assistant, right?&#x201d; she asks, referring to my boss of three days.<br><br>&#x201c;Nikki Fairchild.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I remember now. Nikki from Texas.&#x201d; She looks me up and down, and I wonder if she&#x2019;s disappointed that I don&#x2019;t have big hair and cowboy boots. &#x201c;So who does he want you to charm?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Charm?&#x201d; I repeat, as if I don&#x2019;t know exactly what she means.<br><br>She cocks a single brow. &#x201c;Honey, the man would rather walk on burning coals than come to an art show. He&#x2019;s fishing for investors and you&#x2019;re the bait.&#x201d; She makes a rough noise in the back of her throat. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I won&#x2019;t press you to tell me who. And I don&#x2019;t blame you for hiding out. Carl&#x2019;s brilliant, but he&#x2019;s a bit of a prick.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the brilliant part I signed on for,&#x201d; I say, and she barks out a laugh.<br><br>The truth is that she&#x2019;s right about me being the bait. &#x201c;Wear a cocktail dress,&#x201d; Carl had said. &#x201c;Something flirty.&#x201d;<br><br>Seriously? I mean, Seriously?<br><br>I should have told him to wear his own damn cocktail dress. But I didn&#x2019;t. Because I want this job. I fought to get this job. Carl&#x2019;s company, C-�Squared Technologies, successfully launched three web-�based products in the last eighteen months. That track record had caught the industry&#x2019;s eye, and Carl had been hailed as a man to watch.<br><br>More important from my perspective, that meant he was a man to learn from, and I&#x2019;d prepared for the job interview with an intensity bordering on obsession. Landing the position had been a huge coup for me. So what if he wanted me to wear something flirty? It was a small price to pay.<br><br>Shit.<br><br>&#x201c;I need to get back to being the bait,&#x201d; I say.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, hell. Now I&#x2019;ve gone and made you feel either guilty or self-�conscious. Don&#x2019;t be. Let them get liquored up in there first. You catch more flies with alcohol anyway. Trust me. I know.&#x201d;<br><br>She&#x2019;s holding a pack of cigarettes, and now she taps one out, then extends the pack to me. I shake my head. I love the smell of tobacco&#x2014;�it reminds me of my grandfather&#x2014;�but actually inhaling the smoke does nothing for me.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m too old and set in my ways to quit,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;But God forbid I smoke in my own damn house. I swear, the mob would burn me in effigy. You&#x2019;re not going to start lecturing me on the dangers of secondhand smoke, are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I promise.<br><br>&#x201c;Then how about a light?&#x201d;<br><br>I hold up the itty-�bitty purse. &#x201c;One lipstick, a credit card, my driver&#x2019;s license, and my phone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No condom?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think it was that kind of party,&#x201d; I say dryly.<br><br>&#x201c;I knew I liked you.&#x201d; She glances around the balcony. &#x201c;What the hell kind of party am I throwing if I don&#x2019;t even have one goddamn candle on one goddamn table? Well, fuck it.&#x201d; She puts the unlit cigarette to her mouth and inhales, her eyes closed and her expression rapturous. I can&#x2019;t help but like her. She wears hardly any makeup, in stark contrast to all the other women here tonight, myself included, and her dress is more of a caftan, the batik pattern as interesting as the woman herself.<br><br>She&#x2019;s what my mother would call a brassy broad&#x2014;�loud, large, opinionated, and self-�confident. My mother would hate her. I think she&#x2019;s awesome.<br><br>She drops the unlit cigarette onto the tile and grinds it with the toe of her shoe. Then she signals to one of the catering staff, a girl dressed all in black and carrying a tray of champagne glasses.<br><br>The girl fumbles for a minute with the sliding door that opens onto the balcony, and I imagine those flutes tumbling off, breaking against the hard tile, the scattered shards glittering like a wash of diamonds.<br><br>I picture myself bending to snatch up a broken stem. I see the raw edge cutting into the soft flesh at the base of my thumb as I squeeze. I watch myself clutching it tighter, drawing strength from the pain, the way some people might try to extract luck from a rabbit&#x2019;s foot.<br><br>The fantasy blurs with memory, jarring me with its potency. It&#x2019;s fast and powerful, and a little disturbing because I haven&#x2019;t needed the pain in a long time, and I don&#x2019;t understand why I&#x2019;m thinking about it now, when I feel steady and in control.<br><br>I am fine, I think. I am fine, I am fine, I am fine.<br><br>&#x201c;Take one, honey,&#x201d; Evelyn says easily, holding a flute out to me.<br><br>I hesitate, searching her face for signs that my mask has slipped and she&#x2019;s caught a glimpse of my rawness. But her face is clear and genial.<br><br>&#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t you argue,&#x201d; she adds, misinterpreting my hesitation. &#x201c;I bought a dozen cases and I hate to see good alcohol go to waste. Hell no,&#x201d; she adds when the girl tries to hand her a flute. &#x201c;I hate the stuff. Get me a vodka. Straight up. Chilled. Four olives. Hurry up, now. Do you want me to dry up like a leaf and float away?&#x201d;<br><br>The girl shakes her head, looking a bit like a twitchy, frightened rabbit. Possibly one that had sacrificed his foot for someone else&#x2019;s good luck.<br><br>Evelyn&#x2019;s attention returns to me. &#x201c;So how do you like LA? What have you seen? Where have you been? Have you bought a map of the stars yet? Dear God, tell me you&#x2019;re not getting sucked into all that tourist bullshit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mostly I&#x2019;ve seen miles of freeway and the inside of my apartment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s just sad. Makes me even more glad that Carl dragged your skinny ass all the way out here tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;ve put on fifteen welcome pounds since the years when my mother monitored every tiny thing that went in my mouth, and while I&#x2019;m perfectly happy with my size-�eight ass, I wouldn&#x2019;t describe it as skinny. I know Evelyn means it as a compliment, though, and so I smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad he brought me, too. The paintings really are amazing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now don&#x2019;t do that&#x2014;�don&#x2019;t you go sliding into the polite-conversation routine. No, no,&#x201d; she says before I can protest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you mean it. Hell, the paintings are wonderful. But you&#x2019;re getting the flat-�eyed look of a girl on her best behavior, and we can&#x2019;t have that. Not when I was getting to know the real you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I swear I&#x2019;m not fading away on you.&#x201d;<br><br>Because I genuinely like her, I don&#x2019;t tell her that she&#x2019;s wrong&#x2014;�she hasn&#x2019;t met the real Nikki Fairchild. She&#x2019;s met Social Nikki who, much like Malibu Barbie, comes with a complete set of accessories. In my case, it&#x2019;s not a bikini and a convertible. �Instead, I have the Elizabeth Fairchild Guide for Social Gatherings.<br><br>My mother&#x2019;s big on rules. She claims it&#x2019;s her Southern upbringing. In my weaker moments, I agree. Mostly, I just think she&#x2019;s a controlling bitch. Since the first time she took me for tea at the Mansion at Turtle Creek in Dallas at age three, I have had the rules drilled into my head. How to walk, how to talk, how to dress. What to eat, how much to drink, what kinds of jokes to tell.<br><br>I have it all down, every trick, every nuance, and I wear my practiced pageant smile like armor against the world. The result being that I don&#x2019;t think I could truly be myself at a party even if my life depended on it.<br><br>This, however, is not something Evelyn needs to know.<br><br>&#x201c;Where exactly are you living?&#x201d; she asks.<br><br>&#x201c;Studio City. I&#x2019;m sharing a condo with my best friend from high school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Straight down the 101 for work and then back home again. No wonder you&#x2019;ve only seen concrete. Didn&#x2019;t anyone tell you that you should have taken an apartment on the Westside?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Too pricey to go it alone,&#x201d; I admit, and I can tell that my admission surprises her. When I make the effort&#x2014;�like when I&#x2019;m Social Nikki&#x2014;�I can&#x2019;t help but look like I come from money. Probably because I do. Come from it, that is. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean I brought it with me.<br><br>&#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Twenty-�four.&#x201d;<br><br>Evelyn nods sagely, as if my age reveals some secret about me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be wanting a place of your own soon enough. You call me when you do and we&#x2019;ll find you someplace with a view. Not as good as this one, of course, but we can manage something better than a freeway on-�ramp.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that bad, I promise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course it&#x2019;s not,&#x201d; she says in a tone that says the exact opposite. &#x201c;As for views,&#x201d; she continues, gesturing toward the now-�dark ocean and the sky that&#x2019;s starting to bloom with stars, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re welcome to come back anytime and share mine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I might take you up on that,&#x201d; I admit. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to bring a decent camera back here and take a shot or two.&#x201d;</p><h2>Animal Orchestra (Little Golden Book)</h2><p><b>A classic and beloved Little Golden Book, from the illustrator of&nbsp;<i>Tootle</i>, <i>The Little Red Caboose</i>,&nbsp;and <i>Scuffy the Tugboat</i>.<br></b><br>This rhyming story about an animal orchestra and its hippo conductor is perfect for reading aloud.

First, on the phenomenal plane, when one ceases to resist What-Is and becomes more in harmony with It, one attains a state of Ming, or clear seeing. Having arrived at this point, all action becomes wei wu wei, or action without action (non-forcing) and there is a working in harmony with What-Is to accomplish what is required. Second, as the clear seeing deepens (what he refers to as the opening of the great gate), the understanding arises that there is no one doing anything and that there is only the One doing everything through the many and diverse objective phenomena which serve as Its instruments. From this flows the third and last: the seemingly separate me is a misapprehension, created by the mind which divides everything into pseudo-subject (me) and object (the world outside of this me). This seeming two-ness (dva in Sanskrit, duo in Latin, dual in English), this feeling of being separate and apart, is the root cause of unhappiness.</p><p></p><h2>German Tanks of World War II: 1939-1945 (Technical Guides)</h2><p><b>From heavy tanks to self-propelled guns, this highly</b><b>illustrated technical guide introduces all the main types of armored fighting vehicles used by Germany in World War II. </b><br> &nbsp;<br> Organized chronologically by type, <i>German Tanks of World War II</i> expertly examines the variety of armored fighting vehicles employed in the invasions of Poland, France, the Low Countries, and Stalingrad, as well as in North Africa under Field Marshall Rommel, the Normandy campaign of 1944, and at the Battle of the Bulge.

Grade 8 Up&#x2013;As she did in <i>Cool Salsa</i> (Holt, 1994), Carlson assembles another impressive forum of poetic voices. In Spanish and English, the poets speak eloquently of themselves, how and where they live, their families, and their dreams for the future. Many of them are quite well known and a number were included in the earlier book: Gary Soto, Gina Vald�s, Mart�n Espada, and Luis J. Rodr�guez, among others. In this volume, Carlson has added a few poems by students in the New York City public school system: they, too, are excellent and thought-provoking. Ivette �lvarez, for example, issues a passionate plea in Invisible Boundaries to go beyond the stereotypes that/lock us down and judge us. Other poems will delight readers with their delicate play of language, as in Jos� Antonio Burciaga's Bilingual Love Poem/<i>Poema de amor biling�e</i>, or in Tato Laviera's My Graduation Speech, which conveys a sardonic frustration through its comic mix of languages. By turns humorous and poignant, nostalgic and immediate, these poems represent a diversity of experiences, underpinned by emotions that anyone can recognize. Once again, Oscar Hijuelos's personable, highly readable introduction sets the tone. Carlson has crafted an accessible gem of a collection, and teen readers of all backgrounds will find echoes of their own experiences in its pages.<i>&#x2013;Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Adapting the wisdom of the Westminster Shorter Catechism, <i>The Preacher&#x2019;s Catechism</i> draws us back to what really matters. But make no mistake: the result is profoundly practical. You can read it as a primer or dip in for fresh insight or inspiration. All the way, you&#x2019;ll find plenty to inform, challenge, and encourage your preaching.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Tim Chester,</strong> Pastor, Grace Church Boroughbridge, North Yorkshire; Faculty Member, Crosslands Training</p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Preacher&#x2019;s Catechism</i> is a book from the heart that candidly reflects Allen&#x2019;s own experience of the ups and downs of the preaching ministry. He writes in an engaging and fresh style that provokes thought. Here we find that preachers are &#x2018;heavy lifters&#x2019; who need the &#x2018;Monday gospel.&#x2019; This book will repay slow and reflective reading by preachers. It will foster the joyful obedience of a preacher, but also expose the activity of his flesh in all its ugliness. Take a little dose at a time and ponder it. Find in it pointers to the remedy for both pride and discouragement. I pray that the Lord will use it to bring down the proud in us all, and then to lift up the humble.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Garry J. Williams,</strong> Director, The Pastor&#x2019;s Academy, London Seminary; author, <em>His Love Endures Forever</em> and <em>Silent Witnesses</em></p><p>&#x201c;This book is entirely different from any other. It is directed at the preacher himself rather than the art and craft of preaching, and is all the more useful for it. For too long we have focused on the method at the expense of the man. Allen&#x2019;s creative and content-rich volume goes a long way toward redressing the balance while marrying a familiar format with fresh insight. Every preacher of the Word of God will benefit from spending time in this volume and letting its lessons seep into his bloodstream.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Adrian Reynolds,</strong> Training Director, The Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches</p><p>&#x201c;These warmhearted and practical devotions could also be titled <i>The Preacher&#x2019;s Comfort</i>. Allen gets inside the pastor&#x2019;s head and points him to Jesus Christ in a way that will soothe and strengthen many a weary preacher&#x2019;s soul.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joel R. Beeke,</strong> President and Professor of Systematic Theology and Homiletics, Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary; Pastor, Heritage Reformed Congregation, Grand Rapids, Michigan; author, <em>Reformed Preaching</em></p><p>&#x201c;We live in a Corinthian society, where preaching is regarded as foolishness by both the religious and the nonreligious. We also live in a quick-fix society, where even preaching is considered something that can easily be done. Lewis Allen&#x2019;s ingenious book is an antidote to both of those perspectives&#x2015;insightful, realistic, biblical, clear, and contemporary. I will buy it and use it with preachers I train!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>David Robertson,</strong> Minister, St. Peter&#x2019;s Free Church, Dundee, Scotland; Editor, <em>The Record</em>; Associate Director, Solas Centre for Public Christianity</p><p>&#x201c;Preaching is soul business, and the souls of godly preachers are under continual assault from the world, the flesh, and the Devil. In my last ten years of ministry, I have not read any resource that has so convicted and challenged my soul as has Lewis Allen&#x2019;s <i>The Preacher&#x2019;s Catechism</i>. His creative and detailed application of the theological riches of the Westminster Shorter Catechism to every area of a preacher&#x2019;s soul and practice will continue to feed and protect my ministry for years to come. I will return to it again and again.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Andy Davis,</strong> Senior Pastor, First Baptist Church, Durham, North Carolina</p><p>&#x201c;The weakness of much contemporary preaching stems not primarily from a lack of exegetical technique or presentational skill but from the inadequate spiritual preparation and flawed motives of the preacher. Lewis Allen&#x2019;s new book will challenge preachers to ensure that they proclaim the Word of God with a prayerful desire to see God faithfully disclosed and glorified for who he is, out of a love for his people. Forty-three short chapters apply the core teaching of the Westminster Shorter Catechism specifically to preachers with clarity and insight. Any preacher who reads this book will be humbled, stimulated, challenged, and equipped for the glorious task of preaching, and encouraged to have a deep trust in the power of the Word and the sufficiency of God in this labor. The format is designed for preachers to read alone, perhaps as a daily meditation, but would also be ideal for use by preaching groups, ministers fraternal, or staff teams that want to improve the quality of their preaching.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John Stevens,</strong> National Director, The Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches</p><p>&#x201c;Preachers often work hard to catechize others, but rarely think about being catechized themselves. This is an excellent resource to help us do just that, and I commend it warmly. It&#x2019;s just the kind of book I will use with my preaching team.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Robin Weekes,</strong> Minister, Emmanuel Church, Wimbledon</p></p><h2>Stanley&#39;s Store (Stanley Picture Books, 6)</h2><p>Welcome to Stanley&#x2019;s Store!

Why does the public accept the Court&#x2019;s decisions as legitimate and follow them, even when those decisions are highly unpopular? What must the Court do to maintain the public&#x2019;s faith? How can it help make our democracy work?<br>&nbsp;<br>In this groundbreaking book, Justice Stephen Breyer tackles these questions and more, offering an original approach to interpreting the Constitution that judges, lawyers, and scholars will look to for many years to come.</p></p><p><p><b>Stephen Breyer </b>is an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. He is a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C.</p>Introduction<br><br>Day after day I see Americans&#x2014;of every race, religion, nationality, and point of view&#x2014;trying to resolve their differences in the courtroom. It has not always been so. In earlier times, both here and abroad, individuals and communities settled their differences not in courtrooms under law but on the streets with violence. We Americans treasure the customs and institutions that have helped us find the better way. And we not only hope but also believe that in the future we will continue to resolve disputes under law, just as surely as we will continue to hold elections for president and Congress. Our beliefs reflect the strength of our Constitution and the institutions it has created.<br><br>The Constitution&#x2019;s form and language have helped it endure. The document is short&#x2014;seven articles and twenty- seven amendments. It focuses primarily on our government&#x2019;s structure. Its provisions form a simple coherent whole, permitting readers without technical knowledge to understand the document and the government it creates. And it traces the government&#x2019;s authority directly to a single source of legitimizing power&#x2014;&#x201c;We the People.&#x201d;<br><br>Words on paper, however, no matter how wise, are not sufficient to preserve a nation. Benjamin Franklin made this point when, in 1787, he told a Philadelphia questioner that the Constitutional Convention had created &#x201c;a republic, Madam, if you can keep it.&#x201d; The separate institutions that the Constitution fashioned&#x2014;Congress, the executive, the judiciary&#x2014;were intended to bring about a form of government that would guarantee that democracy and liberty are not empty promises. But what would enable the Constitution to work not only in theory but also in practice? How could the nation make sure that the Constitution&#x2019;s limits are respected, that our citizens enjoy its important protections, that our legal system resolves disputes fairly and impartially, and that our courts dispense justice?<br><br>Alexander Hamilton, along with many of the other constitutional framers, thought that a Supreme Court would provide part of the<br>answer. The Court would interpret the law, thereby enforcing the Constitution&#x2019;s limits. It would help ensure a democratic political system, and it would safeguard individual constitutional rights and liberties. Indeed, as the historian Gordon Wood has pointed out, &#x201c;by protecting the rights of minorities of all sorts against popular majorities,&#x201d; the Court would &#x201c;become a major instrument for both curbing [American] democracy and maintaining it.&#x201d;<br><br>In the framers&#x2019; eyes, then, the Court would help to maintain the<i> workable democracy</i> that the Constitution sought to create. I have previously written about the Court and democracy, explaining the ways in which that constitutional concept critically affects judicial interpretation of much of the Constitution&#x2019;s language and also how the Constitution&#x2019;s democratic objective assumes a public that actively participates in the nation&#x2019;s political life. The present book focuses on the Supreme Court&#x2019;s role in maintaining a <i>workable </i>constitutional system of government. It discusses how the public and the Court can help make the Constitution work well in practice. And it shows why the Constitution necessarily assumes that the typical American learns something of our nation&#x2019;s history and understands how our government works.<br><br>In particular, this book considers two sets of questions. The first concerns the public&#x2019;s willingness to accept the Court&#x2019;s decisions as<br>legitimate. When the Court interprets the law, will the other branches of government follow those interpretations? Will the public do so? Will they implement even those Court decisions that they believe are wrong and that are highly unpopular? Many of us take for granted that the answer to these questions is yes, but this was not always the case. Part I uses examples from our nation&#x2019;s history to show how, after fragile beginnings, the Court&#x2019;s authority has grown. It describes how the Court was given the power to interpret the Constitution authoritatively, striking down congressional statutes that it finds in conflict with the Constitution. And it goes on to describe several instances where Supreme Court decisions were ignored or disobeyed, where the president&#x2019;s or the public&#x2019;s acceptance of Court decisions was seriously in doubt. These examples of the Court&#x2019;s infirmity&#x2014;perhaps startling today&#x2014;demonstrate that public acceptance is not automatic and cannot be taken for granted. The Court itself must help maintain the public&#x2019;s trust in the Court, the public&#x2019;s confidence in the Constitution, and the public&#x2019;s commitment to the rule of law.<br><br>Part II considers how the Court can carry out this constitutional responsibility. The key lies in the Court&#x2019;s ability to apply the Constitution&#x2019;s enduring values to changing circumstances. In carrying out this basic interpretive task, the Court must thoughtfully employ a set of traditional legal tools in service of a pragmatic approach to interpreting the law. It must understand that its actions have real-world consequences. And it must recognize and respect the roles of other governmental institutions. By taking account of its own experience and expertise as well as those of other institutions, the Court can help make the law work more effectively and thereby better achieve the Constitution&#x2019;s basic objective of creating a workable democratic government. My argument in Part II takes the formof examples drawn fromhistory and from the present day, illustrating the Court&#x2019;s relationships with Congress, the executive branch, the states, other courts, and earlier courts. Part of my aim is to show how the Court can build the necessary productive working relationships with other institutions&#x2014;without abdicating its own role as constitutional guardian.<br><br>The Court&#x2019;s role in protecting individual liberties presents special challenges to these relationships, some of which are discussed in Part III. I describe how this protection often involves a search for permanent values underlying particular constitutional phrases. I describe a method (proportionality) useful in applying those values to complex contemporary circumstances. And I discuss the Japanese internment during World War II as well as the recent Guant�namo cases to illustrate the difficulty of finding a proper balance between liberty and security when a president acts in time of war or special security need.<br><br>Throughout, I argue that the Court should interpret written words, whether in the Constitution or a statute, using traditional legal tools, such as text, history, tradition, precedent, and, particularly, purposes and related consequences, to help make the law effective. In this way, the Court can help maintain the public&#x2019;s confidence in the legitimacy of its interpretive role.<br><br>The various approaches that I discuss in Parts II and III fit together. They constitute a set of pragmatic approaches to interpreting the law. They provide a general perspective of how a pragmatically oriented judge might go about deciding the kinds of cases that make up the work of the Supreme Court. I do not argue that judges should decide all legal cases pragmatically. But I also suggest that by understanding that its actions have real-world consequences and taking those consequences into account, the Court can help make the law work more effectively. It can thereby better achieve the Constitution&#x2019;s basic objective of creating a workable democratic government. In this way the Court can help maintain the public&#x2019;s confidence in the legitimacy of its interpretive role. This point, which returns full circle to Part I, is critical. At the end of the day, the public&#x2019;s confidence is what permits the Court to ensure a Constitution that is more than words on paper. It is what enables the Court to ensure that the Constitution functions democratically, that it protects individual liberty, and that it works in practice for the benefit of all Americans. This book explores ways in which I believe the Court can maintain that confidence and thereby carry out its responsibility to help ensure a Constitution that endures.<br>Chapter Three<br><br><i>The Cherokees</i><br>Although <i>Marbury </i>gave the Court the power to refuse to apply an act of Congress on the ground that it violated the Constitution, the Court did not again exercise that power until its decision in the Dred Scott case more than fifty years later. This hesitancy to find a federal statute unconstitutional, like Marshall&#x2019;s strategic view of Marbury, suggests a Court deeply uncertain as to whether the president, the Congress, or the public itself would accept the Court&#x2019;s views about the Constitution&#x2014;at least when they strongly disagreed with those views. And without assurance that other government officials and the public would follow the law, how could the Court successfully exercise its review power? How could it help to protect, say, an unpopular minority? How could it help make the Constitution more than words on paper?<br><br>Today judges from all over the world ask similar questions. A chief justice of an African nation struggling to maintain an independent judiciary recently asked me directly, &#x201c;Why do Americans do what the courts say?&#x201d; What in the Constitution makes this likely? What is the institutional device that makes court decisions effective? What, she wondered, is the secret? I answered that there is no secret; there are no magic words on paper. Following the law is a matter of custom, of habit, of widely shared understandings as to how those in government and members of the public should, and will, act when faced with a court decision they strongly dislike.<br><br>My short answer to the chief justice&#x2019;s question was to say that history, not legal doctrine, tells us how Americans came to follow the<br>Supreme Court&#x2019;s rulings. My longer answer consists of several examples that illustrate different challenges the Court and the nation faced as gradually, over time, the American public developed those customs and habits.<br><br>The Cherokee Indian cases of the 1830s provide an early example of enforceability put to the test. The Cherokee tribe sued to protect its legal rights to its ancestral lands in northern Georgia. The U.S. Supreme Court held in its favor. What happened next is an unhappy story.<br><br>In the first part of the nineteenth century, a dispute developed between the Cherokee Indians and their neighbors, settlers in the state of Georgia. The dispute was simple. The Indians owned land, rocks, and minerals that the white Georgia settlers wanted, and the Indians did not want to give them up. The Georgians had tried hard for two decades to convince three presidents (James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson) to remove the Indian tribes from Georgia and send them to the West. But they got nowhere. Monroe, for example, told the Georgians that he would use only reasonable, peaceful means to convince the tribe to move.<br><br>The Cherokees, who had lived in northern Georgia far longer than the Georgians, had moved on from their purely hunting/fishing life to become farmers and landowners. They had developed an alphabet, established a printing press, and built a capital called New Echota. Under the leadership of their great chief John Ross, they had also adopted a constitution. They had no reason to leave their own land. And they told President Monroe that &#x201c;it is the fixed and unalterable determination of this nation never again to cede one foot more of our land.&#x201d; They added that they were not foreigners but the original inhabitants of America, who &#x201c;now stand on the soil of their own territory&#x201d; and who will not &#x201c;recognize the sovereignty of any State within the limits of their territory.&#x201d; And they would later tell President Andrew Jackson that when they moved, they would not go west but, instead, would only go &#x201c;by the course of nature to sleep under this ground which the Great Spirit gave our ancestors.&#x201d;<br><br>Then, in 1829, gold was found on the Cherokee lands, and the Georgians decided to break the stalemate. They entered the Cherokee territory and began to work the gold mines. They passed laws that nullified all Cherokee laws, prohibited the Cherokee legislature from meeting, and ordered the arrest of any Cherokee who argued against moving to the West. Furthermore, the Georgians found an ally in a new president, Andrew Jackson, who announced his support for Georgia, refused to keep federal troops in the mining area to enforce the Indians&#x2019; rights, and urged the Indians to move west.<br><br>Some in the federal Congress opposed removing the Indians from their homes, churches, and schools to send them to a &#x201c;wilderness.&#x201d; That minority pointed out that the &#x201c;evil . . . is enormous; the violence is extreme; the breach of public faith deplorable; the inevitable suffering incalculable.&#x201d; But a congressional majority felt differently. And Congress enacted a removal bill that was intended to enforce the president&#x2019;s position.<br><br>Lacking sufficient support in the elected branches of the federal government, where could the Cherokees turn for help? Could they look to the law? After supporting the British during the Revolution, the tribe had signed treaties with the new United States in which the United States promised to protect the Cherokees&#x2019; land and guarantee its boundaries. The Constitution specifically says that not only the Constitution and laws made thereunder but also &#x201c;all Treatiesmade . . . under the Authority of the United States shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the . . . Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.&#x201d;<br><br>Although the Cherokees&#x2019; legal case seemed ironclad, the same political circumstances that led them to put their hopes in the law made it difficult to get that law enforced. The Georgians would not protect them. A majority in Congress apparently did not care. And Andrew Jackson had refused the Indians&#x2019; request to enforce their treaty. Hence, the Cherokees could look only to the courts for protection. <br><br>But the tribe&#x2019;s unpopularity and political weakness made bringing a lawsuit more difficult than one might think. The tribe found a lawyer, William Wirt, a former attorney general of the United States and one of the greatest lawyers of his day. Wirt thought that &#x201c;the Supreme Court would protect&#x201d; the tribe. But Wirt could not be certain that Georgia would follow the law, even if embodied in a Supreme Court decision. After all, some years earlier, when John Quincy Adams was president, the Georgians had seized land belonging to the Creek tribe, passed resolutions declaring they owned it, sent surveyors to map the territory, and said they would &#x201c;resist to the utmost&#x201d; any federal effort, including any Supreme Court effort, to stop them. After all this, the Creeks just<br>gave up.<br><br>Moreover, how was Wirt to get his case to the Supreme Court? He hesitated to bring a case in Georgia&#x2019;s own courts&#x2014;for example, by suing Georgians for trespass. He feared that Georgia state judges might indefinitely delay matters by raising problems of state property law. He thought for a time that he might represent a Cherokee Indian&#x2014;Corn Tassel&#x2014;whom the Georgians had arrested for committing a serious crime in Cherokee territory. Wirt would appeal Corn Tassel&#x2019;s case to the Supreme Court, arguing that Georgia did not have the power to enforce its laws in the Cherokees&#x2019; territory. But Georgia&#x2019;s governor and legislature announced that they would pay no attention to the Court&#x2019;s decision and would resist with force any effort to enforce a Supreme Court order. To make certain a Court order would have no effect, Georgia executed Corn Tassel before the Supreme Court could hear the case.<br><br>Wirt next tried suing Georgia directly in the Supreme Court, in the case of <i>Cherokee Nation v.

It admirably describes how to target relevant and largely transdiagnostic processes to promote healthy growth and development.

In this remarkable book, two of the leading theorists and clinical scientists in the world, Steven Hayes and Stefan Hofmann, make a strong case that going forward CBT must focus on fundamental transdiagnostic psychopathological processes and core behavioral interventions in what they call the process model of CBT. This is clearly the future of our science and profession.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;David H.

This book, edited by leaders in clinical psychology&#x2014;Steven Hayes and Stefan Hofmann&#x2014;brings a new vision for CBT. It superbly ties together undergirding processes through our in-session work and procedures, with an impetus for new diagnostic, formulation, assessment, design, and analytic methodologies.

As the first, to my knowledge, to address in one place the training standards and clinical competencies outlined by the <i>Inter-Organizational Task Force on Cognitive and Behavioral Psychology Doctoral Education</i>, it is likely to become a core text in doctoral-level CBT training programs. Moreover, its explication of the epistemologies, theories, basic principles, and core processes that comprise CBT as a field will facilitate the evolution of CBT and the empirically based treatment movement from simply matching interventions and syndromes to one that selects and customizes clinical interventions based on empirically supported theory and contextual analysis.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Michael J.

This rich collection of topics integrates the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, motivational, and interpersonal as well as acceptance and mindfulness traditions within psychological treatments. It is a major step forward and provides a new standard for the future of evidence-based psychotherapy. Anyone interested in psychological treatments will find it comprehensive as well as fun to read.

Hayes, Hofmann, and colleagues have taken an entirely different approach. They move the field forward by eschewing false dichotomies and unnecessarily simplistic caricatures of CBT, and by embracing the many empirically supported processes of change underlying cognitive and behavioral therapies.

Since then, both the first book and the website have brought us into contact with thousands of investors who, with their equally numerous questions, have provided us with interesting and meaningful insight into how the information and methods we cover in our first book and our website is processed and understood. In other words, these questions have helped us to understand what investors have difficulty understanding, and this new book largely addresses those issues. As well, we delve into the nitty-gritty of utilizing our methods with discussions and introspective quizzes regarding one's trading psychology, detailed trading simulations, and the entire issue of exactly where the "rubber meets the road" when it comes to using our enhanced O'Neil-style trading and investing techniques.</p> <strong>What are some of William J. O'Neil's trading techniques and what makes them a timeless ongoing winning strategy?</strong> <p>While the times may change, human psychology does not, and William J. O'Neil built upon the work of his predecessors such as Jesse Livermore, Nicholas Darvas, Richard Wyckoff and others to originate his system of finding and investing in entrepreneurial-oriented growth stocks. The essence of O'Neil-style investing is the search for innovative companies creating new products and services that drive the leading edge of any economic growth phase, such as former and present market leaders like Apple (AAPL) in the New Millennium; America Online (AOL) in the late 1990s; Cisco Systems (CSCO) throughout the 1990s; and Microsoft (MSFT), Walmart (WMT), and Home Depot (HD) in the 1980s.</p> <p>It is companies like these during their high growth periods that are the de facto lifeblood of the world economy and offer some of the most compelling profit opportunities in the stock market. O'Neil essentially codified the fundamental and technical characteristics of these stocks from a historical perspective that is then utilized as a real-time template for finding similar leaders in the present.</p> <strong>How do you incorporate your own trading strategies with those of O'Neil?</strong> <p>Our trading strategies are intended to enhance one's use of the O'Neil method, not replace it. Based on our experience as former portfolio managers for William J. O'Neil + Company and investors who have used his methods for well over two decades, we found that the main difficulty for most investors is not in being able to find a potentially big, winning stock, but in understanding proper entry points and, even more importantly, how to handle a big, winning stock once you have it in your portfolio. By overlaying the O'Neil system with additional buy points like "pocket pivots" and "buyable gap-ups," we arm readers with practical tools that not only identify concrete buy points, both at the outset of a new trend and in the middle of an existing trend in a leading stock, but also provide early and alternative entry/buy points in potential leading stocks in an era where the "crowd" sees obvious technical buy signals such as range or base breakouts.</p> <strong>What is the Seven-Week Rule for when to sell?</strong> <p>The Seven-Week Rule is a practical position-management system that identifies the use of the 10-day and 50-day moving averages at appropriate junctures within a leading stock's overall price move, providing concrete stop-loss points along the way that help investors preserve gains. Our studies show that leading stocks will tend to follow either the 10-day or 50-day moving average, and that they can shift from following one to the other at various points during an intermediate-term upside price trend. Using the Seven-Week Rule to determine which moving average is used at which point in combination with pocket pivots and buyable gap-ups provides the investor with a practical system for buying, building, handling and selling positions in big, winning stocks.</p> <strong>What key technical signals can be used today to analyze stock movements and predict the price trends of an array of leading stocks?</strong> <p>We use pocket pivots and buyable gap-ups not only as buy signals, but also as a feedback mechanism for assessing the market's health and bull market potential. In strong, constructive market environments, leading stocks will often show a number of such buy points and provide investors with concrete, ready buy signals upon which to act in real-time. In a healthy market environment, upside follow-through will generally be seen following such buy signals. In a weaker and less trending market environment such as we believe we are in today, these buy points will tend to fail more often or show little upside progress after the actual signal. In this case, such a "feedback loop" also serves an extremely useful purpose in telling us that the market environment is a dicey and perhaps dangerous proposition where the odds of upside success are not in our favor.</p><p>In their bestselling <i>Trade Like an O'Neil Disciple,</i> Gil Morales and Dr. Chris Kacher described their experiences working side-by-side with market legend William O'Neil and how they made a fortune using his original stock trading strategies.

With the help of his sympathetic mother, he gently wraps the injured bird and takes it home. In classic Bob Graham style, the beauty is in the details: the careful ministrations with an eyedropper, the bedroom filled with animal memorabilia, the saving of the single feather as a good-luck charm for the bird's return to the sky. Wistful and uplifting, here is a tale of possibility &#x2014; and of the souls who never doubt its power.</p><p><b>Bob Graham</b>&nbsp;is the author-illustrator of many acclaimed books for children.&nbsp;<br><br>Of&nbsp;<i>How to Heal a Broken Wing</i>, he says: "In troubled times, when many of us are losing contact with the natural world, I wanted to show that there is still hope in a coming generation of children who have curiosity and empathy with the world around them, and that care and attention can sometimes fix broken wings."<br><br>Bob Graham lives in Australia.*Starred Review* Quietly, effectively, Graham tells the simple story of a boy who finds a fallen bird and nurses it back to health. The text is minimal. In a busy city, &#x201c;No one saw the bird fall.&#x201d; But a little boy walking with his mother spies the injured bird&nbsp;and brings it home. Up until this point, the art has effectively utilized the oversize format, filling it&nbsp;with full-page pictures, vertical and horizontal strips, and cartoon-style boxes in cloudy hues. At the moment the boy lifts the bird, Graham&nbsp;slows the story&nbsp;and offers a&nbsp;two-page spread full of&nbsp;bright, hopeful colors and an intense focus on the boy with the bird in hand. Turn the page and both mood and perspective change&nbsp;once more. Now the pages are full of people, walking, biking, rushing, while in an upper corner of the spread, encircled in a glow, readers find boy and bird; the unspoken, unwritten message is clear. Who cares in such a large place if a small pigeon falls? One child does. Although the rest of the story is a little anticlimactic, there is a satisfying reality to it as the bird is bandaged, heals, and is set free. Because this is such a visual piece, however, readers, young and old,&nbsp;will return to&nbsp;the story&nbsp;to look more deeply; they won&#x2019;t be disappointed.

I am deeply grateful for the careful attention he has shown to biblical teaching, along with his fair and winsome interaction with scholarship throughout this volume.

Ware,</strong>&nbsp;T. Rupert and Lucille Coleman Professor of Christian Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;The structure of this book contributes to its appeal. The nine chapters cover the theological meat of the theme, the five excursuses address such sidebars as the meaning of Genesis 6:1&#x2013;4 and how to test the spirits, and the three appendices survey adjacent but highly relevant themes (how these themes are treated in Islam on the one hand, and in various Christian creeds on the other). The book is comprehensive and edifying&#x2015;and more important than one might initially think, in a culture that wants to be touched by an angel.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>D. A. Carson,</strong>&nbsp;Emeritus Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; Cofounder, The Gospel Coalition</p><p>&#x201c;In a modern secular age, it is all too easy for Christians to overlook the major source of conflict in the drama of redemption: the devilish powers of darkness that seek to seduce hearts away from the truth of the gospel with glittering images and empty promises. Graham Cole rightly reminds us that, while angels and demons are not at the heart of biblical revelation, to ignore them is to risk being blindsided. <i>Against the Darkness</i> is a model of how to judiciously read Scripture and formulate Christian doctrine on matters that are both peripheral and essential to the Bible&#x2019;s main storyline. This is theology for the twenty-first-century church, and Cole helpfully draws out the pastoral implications of angelology and demonology&#x2015;all the while never losing sight of the centrality of Jesus Christ and his lordship over the angelic and earthly realms.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Kevin J. Vanhoozer,</strong> Research Professor of Systematic Theology, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; author, <em>The Drama of Doctrine</em>; <em>Hearers and Doers</em>; <em>Biblical Authority after Babel</em>; and <em>Faith Speaking Understanding</em></p><p>&#x201c;We live in a culture that pretends the spiritual realm does not exist. Reducing that which is real to that which can be seen and touched, our culture catechizes its pupils in a worldview that dismisses angels and demons. It laughs at those who believe in the devil and his hell. So when we act disinterested in angels, Satan, and demons, we invite this secular outlook to control the biblical narrative. Although we profess faith in a God who has overcome the evil one, in reality our indifference reveals us to be practical atheists. Graham Cole exposes this blind spot, demonstrating that our theology of angels, Satan, and demons is not irrelevant but takes us to the center of the gospel itself. For if Christ has suffered for our sins and risen for our justification, then Satan no longer has power and victory over us. Read <i>Against the Darkness</i> and discover how God has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Matthew Barrett,</strong> Associate Professor of Christian Theology, Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary; Executive Editor, Credo Magazine; editor, <em>Reformation Theology</em></p><p>&#x201c;This is theology at its best. Written by one of evangelicalism&#x2019;s finest theologians, <i>Against the Darkness</i> is biblical, systematic, pastoral, fresh, and faithful. It is exegetically driven, historically rooted, philosophically astute, globally aware, systematically related, and crisply written. And it is downright interesting, addressing pressing questions with carefulness and candor.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Christopher W. Morgan,</strong> Dean and Professor of Theology, California Baptist University; editor, Theology in Community series; coeditor, <em>ESV Systematic Theology Study Bible</em></p><p>&#x201c;We commit heresy by contradicting or distorting Biblical revelation. We also commit heresy by politely ignoring the bits we find difficult or unacceptable! So even in orthodox circles, we commit heresy by ignoring what the Bible reveals about angels, Satan, and demons. We are syncretists, captive to the rationalistic Enlightenment. What we ignore in the Biblical revelation distorts our gospel preaching and teaching. Graham Cole&#x2019;s excellent book is a timely and judicious study of what the Bible teaches on these topics, in the context of historical theology, contemporary thinking, and the practice of Christian life and ministry. He shows us that we must not misunderstand these topics, but that we also cannot ignore them. We need this book!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Peter Adam,</strong> Vicar Emeritus, St. Jude&#x2019;s Carlton; Former Principal, Ridley College, Melbourne</p></p><h2>The Moons of August</h2><p>Winner of the 2013 Autumn House Press Poetry Contest, selected by Naomi Shihab Nye.

For as long as they have lived on the frontier, the Bemis and Webber families have relied on each other. With no other settlers for miles, it is a matter of survival. But when Ernest Bemis finds his wife, Cora, in a compromising situation with their neighbor, he doesn&#x2019;t think of survival. In one impulsive moment, a man is dead, Ernest is off to prison, and the women left behind are divided by rage and remorse.</p><p>Losing her husband to Cora&#x2019;s indiscretion is another hardship for stoic Nettie Mae. But as a brutal Wyoming winter bears down, Cora and Nettie Mae have no choice but to come together as one family&#x2014;to share the duties of working the land and raising their children. There&#x2019;s Nettie Mae&#x2019;s son, Clyde&#x2014;no longer a boy, but not yet a man&#x2014;who must navigate the road to adulthood without a father to guide him, and Cora&#x2019;s daughter, Beulah, who is as wild and untamable as her prairie home.</p><p>Bound by the uncommon threads in their lives and the challenges that lie ahead, Cora and Nettie Mae begin to forge an unexpected sisterhood.

For me, fear was a given I factored into the events of the day, like a pebble that never leaves your shoe. In retrospect, an adult might call that a form of courage. If so, it wasn&#x2019;t much fun.<br> <br>My tale begins on a Saturday at the close of spring term of my junior year in 1952, when my father let me use his car to join my high school buds on Galveston Beach, fifty miles south of Houston. Actually, the car was not his; it was lent to him by his company for business use, with the understanding that only he would drive it. That he would lend it to me was an act of enormous trust. My friends and I had a fine day playing touch football on the sand, and as they built a bonfire toward evening, I decided to swim out to the third sandbar south of the island, the last place your feet could still touch bottom. It was not only deep and cold, it was also hammerhead country. I had never done this by myself, and even when I once swam to the third sandbar with a group, most of us had been drunk.<br> <br>I waded through the breakers, then inhaled deeply and dove into the first swell and kept stroking through the waves, crossing the first sandbar and then the second, never resting, turning my face sideways to breathe, until I saw the last sandbar, waves undulating across its crest, gulls dipping into the froth.<br> <br>I stood erect, my back tingling with sunburn. The only sounds were the gulls and the water slapping against my loins. I could see a freighter towing a scow, then they both disappeared beyond the horizon. I dove headlong into a wave and saw the sandy bottom drop away into darkness. The water was suddenly frigid, the waves sliding over me as heavy as concrete. The hotels and palm trees and the amusement pier on the beach had become miniaturized. A triangular-shaped fin sliced through the swell and disappeared beneath a wave, a solitary string of bubbles curling behind it.<br> <br>Then I felt my heart seize, and not because of a shark. I was surrounded by jellyfish, big ones with bluish-pink air sacs and gossamer tentacles that could wrap around your neck or thighs like swarms of wet yellow jackets.<br> <br>My experience with the jellyfish seemed to characterize my life. No matter how sun-spangled the day might seem, I always felt a sense of danger. It wasn&#x2019;t imaginary, either. The guttural roar of Hollywood mufflers on a souped-up Ford coupe, a careless glance at the guys in ducktail haircuts and suede stomps and pegged pants called drapes, and in seconds you could be pounded into pulp. Ever watch a television portrayal of the fifties? What a laugh.<br> <br>A psychiatrist would probably say my fears were an externalization of my problems at home. Maybe he would be right, although I have always wondered how many psychiatrists have gone up against five or six guys who carried chains and switchblades and barber razors, and didn&#x2019;t care if they lived or died, and ate their pain like ice cream. Or maybe I saw the world through a glass darkly and the real problem was me. The point is, I was always scared. Just like swimming through the jellyfish. Contact with just one of them was like touching an electric cable. My fear was so great I was urinating inside my swim trunks, the warmth draining along my thighs. Even after I had escaped the jellyfish and rejoined my high school chums by a bonfire, sparks twisting into a turquoise sky, a bottle of cold Jax in my hand, I could not rid myself of the abiding sense of terror that rested like hot coals in the pit of my stomach.<br> <br>I never discussed my home life with my friends. My mother consulted fortune-tellers, listened in on the party line, and was always giving me enemas when I was a child. She locked doors and pulled down window shades and inveighed against alcohol and the effect it had on my father. Theatricality and depression and genuine sorrow seemed her constant companions. Sometimes I would see the cautionary look in the eyes of our neighbors when my parents were mentioned in a conversation, as though they needed to protect me from learning about my own home. In moments like these I&#x2019;d feel shame and guilt and anger and not know why. I&#x2019;d sit in my bedroom, wanting to hold something that was heavy and hard in my palm, I didn&#x2019;t know what. My uncle Cody was a business partner of Frankie Carbo of Murder, Inc. My uncle introduced me to Bugsy Siegel when he was staying at the Shamrock Hotel with Virginia Hill. Sometimes I would think about these gangsters and the confidence in their expression and the deadness in their eyes when they gazed at someone they didn&#x2019;t like, and I&#x2019;d wonder what it would be like if I could step inside their skin and possess their power.<br> <br>The day I swam through the jellyfish without being stung was the day that changed my life forever. I was about to enter a country that had no flag or boundaries, a place where you gave up your cares and your cautionary instincts and deposited your heart on a stone altar. I&#x2019;m talking about the first time you fall joyously, sick-down-in-your-soul in love, and the prospect of heartbreak never crosses your mind.<br> <br>Her name was Valerie Epstein. She was sitting in a long-bodied pink Cadillac convertible, what we used to call a boat, in a drive-in restaurant wrapped in neon, near the beach, her bare shoulders powdered with sunburn. Her hair wasn&#x2019;t just auburn; it was thick and freshly washed and had gold streaks in it, and she had tied it up on her head with a bandana, like one of the women who worked in defense plants during the war. She was eating french fries one at a time with her fingers and listening to a guy sitting behind the steering wheel like a tall drink of water. His hair was lightly oiled and sun-bleached, his skin pale and free of tattoos. He wore shades, even though the sun was molten and low in the sky, the day starting to cool. With his left hand he kept working a quarter across the tops of his fingers, like a Las Vegas gambler or a guy with secret skills. His name was Grady Harrelson. He was two years older than I and had already graduated, which meant I knew who he was but he didn&#x2019;t know who I was. Grady had wide, thin shoulders, like a basketball player, and wore a faded purple T-shirt that on him somehow looked stylish. He had been voted the most handsome boy in the school not once but twice. A guy like me had no trouble hating a guy like Grady.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know why I got out of my car. I was tired, and my back felt stiff and dry and peppered with salt and sand under my shirt, and I had to drive fifty miles back to Houston and return the car to my father before dark. The evening star was already winking inside a blue band of light on the horizon. I had seen Valerie Epstein twice from a distance but never up close. Maybe the fact that I&#x2019;d swum safely through a school of jellyfish was an omen. Valerie Epstein was a junior at Reagan High School, on the north side of Houston, and known for her smile and singing voice and straight A&#x2019;s. Even the greaseballs who carried chains under their car seats and stilettos in their drapes treated her as royalty.<br> <br>Get back in the car and finish your crab burger and go home, a voice said.<br> <br>For me, low self-esteem was not a step down but a step up. I was alone, yet I didn&#x2019;t want to go home. It was Saturday, and I knew that before dark my father would walk unsteadily back from the icehouse, the neighbors looking the other way while they watered their yards. I had friends, but most of them didn&#x2019;t know the real me, nor in reality did I know them. I lived in an envelope of time and space that I wanted to mail to another planet.<br> <br>I headed for the restroom, on a path between the passenger side of the convertible and a silver-painted metal stanchion with a speaker on it that was playing &#x201c;Red Sails in the Sunset.&#x201d; Then I realized Valerie Epstein was having an argument with Grady and on the brink of crying.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anything wrong?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Grady turned around, his neck stretching, his eyelids fluttering. &#x201c;Say again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought maybe something was wrong and y&#x2019;all needed help.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get lost, snarf.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a snarf?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you deaf?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just want to know what a snarf is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A guy who gets off on sniffing girls&#x2019; bicycle seats. Now beat it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The music speaker went silent. My ears were popping. I could see people&#x2019;s lips moving in the other cars, but I couldn&#x2019;t hear any sound. Then I said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel like it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I heard you right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a free country.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not for nosy frumps, it isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Leave him alone, Grady,&#x201d; Valerie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a frump?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;A guy who farts in the bathtub and bites the bubbles. Somebody put you up to this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was going to the restroom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then go.&#x201d;<br> <br>This time I didn&#x2019;t reply. Somebody, probably one of Grady&#x2019;s friends, flicked a hot cigarette at my back. Grady opened his car door so he could turn around and speak without getting a crick in his neck. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, pencil dick?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aaron Holland Broussard.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m about to walk you into the restroom and unscrew your head and stuff it in the commode, Aaron Holland Broussard. Then I&#x2019;m going to piss on it before I flush. What do you think of that?&#x201d;<br> <br>The popping sound in my ears started again. The parking lot and the canvas canopy above the cars seemed to tilt sideways; the red and yellow neon on the restaurant became a blur, like licorice melting, running down the windows.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing to say?&#x201d; Grady asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;A girl told me the only reason you won &#x2018;most handsome&#x2019; is that all the girls thought you were queer-bait and felt sorry for you. Some of the jocks told me the same thing. They said you used to chug pole under the seats at the football stadium.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know where the words came from. I felt like the wiring between my thoughts and my words had been severed. Cracking wise to an older guy just didn&#x2019;t happen at my high school, particularly if the older guy lived in River Oaks and his father owned six rice mills and an independent drilling company. But something even more horrible was occurring as I stood next to Grady&#x2019;s convertible. I was looking into the eyes of Valerie Epstein as though hypnotized. They were the most beautiful and mysterious eyes I had ever seen; they were deep-set, luminous, the color of violets. They were also doing something to me I didn&#x2019;t think possible: In the middle of the drive-in, my twanger had gone on autopilot. I put my hand in my pocket and tried to knock down the tent forming in my fly.<br> <br>&#x201c;You got a boner?&#x201d; Grady said, incredulous.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my car keys. They punched a hole in my pocket.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he said, his face contorting with laughter. &#x201c;Hey, everybody, dig this guy! He&#x2019;s flying the flag. Anyone got a camera? When&#x2019;s the last time you got your ashes hauled, Snarfus?&#x201d;<br> <br>My face was burning. I felt I was in one of those dreams in which you wet your pants at the front of the classroom. Then Valerie Epstein did something I would never be able to repay her for, short of opening my veins. She flung her carton of french fries, ketchup and all, into Grady&#x2019;s face. At first he was too stunned to believe what she had done; he began picking fries from his skin and shirt like bloody leeches and flicking them on the asphalt. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m letting this pass. You&#x2019;re not yourself. Settle down. You want me to apologize to this kid? Hey, buddy, I&#x2019;m sorry. Yeah, you, fuckface. Here, you want some fries? I&#x2019;ll stick a couple up your nose.&#x201d;<br> <br>She got out of the car and slammed the door. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re pathetic,&#x201d; she said, jerking a graduation ring and its chain from her neck, hurling it on the convertible seat. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call. Don&#x2019;t come by the house. Don&#x2019;t write. Don&#x2019;t send your friends to make excuses for you, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Val. We&#x2019;re a team,&#x201d; he said, wiping his face with a paper napkin. &#x201c;You want another Coke?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s over, Grady. You can&#x2019;t help what you are. You&#x2019;re selfish and dishonest and disrespectful and cruel. In my stupidity, I thought I could change you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll work this out. I promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>She wiped her eyes and didn&#x2019;t answer. Her face was calm now, even though her breath was still catching, as though she had hiccups.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do this to me, Val,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I love you. Get real. Are you going to let a dork like this break us up?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Goodbye, Grady.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How you going to get home?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to worry about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to leave you on the street. Now get in. You&#x2019;re starting to make me mad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What a tragedy for the planet that would be,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You know what my father said of you? &#x2018;Grady&#x2019;s not a bad kid. He&#x2019;s simply incapable of being a good one.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come back. Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you have a great life,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Even though the memory of kissing you makes me want to rinse my mouth with peroxide.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then she walked away, like Helen of Troy turning her back on Attica. A gust of warm wind blew newspapers along the boulevard into the sky. The light was orange and bleeding out of the clouds in the west, the horizon darkening, the waves crashing on the beach just the other side of Seawall Boulevard, the palm trees rattling dryly in the wind. I could smell the salt and the seaweed and the tiny shellfish that had dried on the beach, like the smell of birth. I watched Valerie walk through the cars to the boulevard, her beach bag swinging from her shoulder and bouncing on her butt. Grady was standing next to me, breathing hard, his gaze locked on Valerie, just as mine was, except there was an irrevocable sense of loss in his eyes that made me think of a groundswell, the kind you see rising from the depths when a storm is about to surge inland.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry this happened to y&#x2019;all,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re in public, so I can&#x2019;t do what I&#x2019;m thinking. But you&#x2019;d better find a rat hole and crawl in it,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Blaming others won&#x2019;t help your situation,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>He wiped a streak of ketchup off his cheek. &#x201c;I was hoping you&#x2019;d say something like that.&#x201d;</p><h2>Poems That Make Grown Men Cry: 100 Men on the Words That Move Them</h2><p>A life-enhancing tour through classic and contemporary poems that have made men cry: &#x201c;The Holdens remind us that you don&#x2019;t have to be an academic or a postgraduate in creative writing to be moved by verse....It&#x2019;s plain fun&#x201d; (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>).<br><br><i>Grown men aren&#x2019;t supposed to cry...</i>Yet in this fascinating anthology, one hundred men&#x2014;distinguished in literature and film, science and architecture, theater and human rights&#x2014;confess to being moved to tears by poems that continue to haunt them. Although the majority are public figures not prone to crying, here they admit to breaking down, often in words as powerful as the poems themselves.<br> <br>Their selections include classics by visionaries, such as Walt Whitman, W.H. Auden, and Philip Larkin, as well as modern works by masters, including Billy Collins, Seamus Heaney, Derek Walcott, and poets who span the globe from Pablo Neruda to Rabindranath Tagore. The poems chosen range from the sixteenth century to the twenty-first, with more than a dozen by women, including Mary Oliver, Elizabeth Bishop, and Gwendolyn Brooks. Their themes range from love in its many guises, through mortality and loss, to the beauty and variety of nature. All are moved to tears by the exquisite way a poet captures, in Alexander Pope&#x2019;s famous phrase, &#x201c;what oft was thought, but ne&#x2019;er so well express&#x2019;d.&#x201d;<br> <br>From J.J.

My wife and I went straight round to join him for the evening, during which he began to quote a Thomas Hardy poem, &#x201c;The Darkling Thrush.&#x201d; Upon reaching what might be called the punch line&#x2014;&#x201c;Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew / And I was unaware&#x201d;&#x2014;our friend choked up, unable to get the words out. This was understandable; he was still upset by the day&#x2019;s events. We ourselves were much moved.<br> <br>That weekend we happened to be visiting the scholar and critic Frank Kermode. Frank knew the friend involved, and was also touched by his Hardy moment. &#x201c;Is there any poem you can&#x2019;t recite without choking up?&#x201d; I asked him. Never an emotionally demonstrative man, Frank said immediately: &#x201c;Go and get the Larkin.&#x201d;<br> <br>In front of his half-dozen guests he then began to read aloud &#x201c;Unfinished Poem,&#x201d; about death treading its remorseless way up the stairs, only to turn out to be a pretty young girl with bare feet, moving the stunned narrator to exclaim: &#x201c;What summer have you broken from?&#x201d; It was this startling last line that rendered Frank speechless; with a forlorn waft of the hand, he held the book out for someone else to finish the poem.<br> <br>Also there that day was another professor of English, Tony Tanner, so it was not surprising that this topic of conversation lasted all afternoon, ranging far and wide, not just over other candidates for this distinct brand of poetic immortality but the power of poetry over prose to move, the difference between true sentiment and mere mawkishness, and, of course, the pros and cons of men weeping, whether in private or in public.<br> <br>For the next few weeks I asked every male literary friend I saw to name a poem he couldn&#x2019;t read or recite without breaking up. It was amazing how many immediately said yes, this one, and embarked on its first few lines. With Frank&#x2019;s encouragement, I began to contemplate an anthology called Poems that Make Strong Men Cry.<br> <br>Then I remembered I had another book to finish, and set the project aside. But it remained a topic of paradoxically happy conversation between Frank and myself until his death in the summer of 2010, at the age of ninety. I duly steeled myself to reading &#x201c;Unfinished Poem&#x201d; at his funeral service and managed it&#x2014;just&#x2014;without choking up.<br> <br>In 2007, reviewing A. E. Housman&#x2019;s letters for the London Review of Books, Kermode had discussed the controversy caused in Cambridge in 1933 by a Housman lecture entitled &#x201c;On the Name and Nature of Poetry.&#x201d; After recalling the brouhaha provoked at the time by Housman&#x2019;s emphasis on the emotional power of poetry, with F. R. Leavis saying it would &#x201c;take years to remedy the damage the lecture must have inflicted on his students,&#x201d; Frank continued&#x2014;with, he told me, our recurrently lachrymose conversation very much in mind:<br> <br>What everybody remembers best are the passages about the emotional aspects of poetry. Housman included a number of surprisingly personal comments on this topic. Milton&#x2019;s &#x201c;Nymphs and shepherds, dance no more,&#x201d; he said, can &#x201c;draw tears&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to the eyes of more readers than one.&#x201d; And tears are only one symptom. A line of poetry can make his beard bristle as he shaves, or cause a shiver down his spine, or &#x201c;a constriction of the throat&#x201d; as well as &#x201c;a precipitation of water to the eyes.&#x201d; For so reticent a man it was a surprising performance. It possibly upset his health, and he came to regard the date of the lecture, May 1933, as an ominous moment in his life.<br> <br>Housman and Hardy have emerged as two of the most tear-provoking poets in this collection&#x2014;to which I was urged to return, in the wake of Frank&#x2019;s death, by my son Ben (if with a somewhat less macho title). With three entries each, they are equaled by Philip Larkin and bested only by W. H. Auden, with five. So four of us supposedly buttoned-up Brits top the charts of almost one hundred poems from eighteen countries, a dozen of them written by women, chosen by men of more than twenty nationalities ranging in age from early twenties to late eighties. Five pairs of contributors happen to have chosen the same poem, for intriguingly different reasons.<br> <br>Larkin himself could have proved a prototype contributor. &#x201c;Wordsworth was nearly the price of me once,&#x201d; he told the [London] Observer in 1979. &#x201c;I was driving down the M1 on a Saturday morning: they had this poetry slot on the radio&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and someone suddenly started reading the Immortality Ode, and I couldn&#x2019;t see for tears. And when you&#x2019;re driving down the middle lane at seventy miles an hour&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Early in our task, we were encouraged by a note from Professor John Carey, with whom I discussed our work-in-progress over a dinner at Merton College, Oxford, where Ben and I both studied English thirty years apart: &#x201c;It will bring some good poems to public notice, and it will stimulate debate about the emotional power of art and how it affects different people.&#x201d; Thanks to our partnership with Amnesty International, we can add such cross-border issues as freedom of speech and thought, as in the contribution from one of the leaders of the 1989 human rights protests in Beijing&#x2019;s Tiananmen Square.<br> <br>After deciding to arrange the poems in chronological order, we calculated that some 75 percent of them were written in the twentieth century&#x2014;inevitable, perhaps, so early in the twenty-first. The most common themes, apart from intimations of mortality, range from pain and loss via social and political ideals to the beauty and variety of Nature&#x2014;as well as love, in all its many guises. Three of our contributors have suffered the ultimate pain of losing a child; others are moved to tears by the sheer beauty of the way a poet captures, in Alexander Pope&#x2019;s famous phrase, &#x201c;what oft was thought, but ne&#x2019;er so well express&#x2019;d.&#x201d; The same might be said of our contributors&#x2019; candid explanations of their choices, many of which rival the poems themselves in stirring the reader&#x2019;s emotions.<br> <br>Some of those who declined to take part did so for almost poetic reasons. Wrote the pianist Alfred Brendel: &#x201c;I easily shed tears when I listen to music, experience a Shakespeare play, or encounter a great performance. Literature doesn&#x2019;t have the same effect on me, so it seems. I cannot tell you why, as reading has been an important part of my life.&#x201d; Said the actor-magician Ricky Jay: &#x201c;Right now, I find it hard to think of a poem that doesn&#x2019;t make me cry. I&#x2019;m the kinda guy that weeps at reruns of Happy Days.&#x201d; And the playwright Patrick Marber: &#x201c;You bet I&#x2019;ve got one, but I&#x2019;m not going to share it with anyone else!&#x201d;<br> <br>A sudden shock of emotion naturally overcomes different people in different ways. Vladimir Nabokov wrote that the proper reader responds to a poem not with his brain or his heart, but with his back, waiting for &#x201c;the telltale tingle between the shoulder-blades.&#x201d; To our contributors, a moist eye seems the natural if involuntary response to a particular phrase or line, thought or image; the vast majority are public figures not prone to tears, as is supposedly the manly way, but here prepared to admit to caving in when ambushed by great art.<br> <br><br> <br>The youngest of my three sons, now himself a father, Ben is a grown man to whom tears do not come readily; I myself, as he has enjoyed telling all inquirers, am prone to weep all too easily, at prose as much as poetry, movies as much as music. We&#x2019;ve had a great deal of fun, and not a few vigorous disagreements, while compiling this anthology together.<br> <br>It was only after intense negotiation, for instance, that we agreed to stretch most definitions of poetry by including an extract from a verse play, and another from a &#x201c;prose-poem&#x201d; of a novel, then another, while drawing the line at song lyrics&#x2014;some of which are fine poetry, for sure, but (in my view) indistinguishable in their power to move from the music to which they are set. We agreed to admit one traditional lullaby; but this policy otherwise cost us, alas, a distinguished writer intent on a touching French chanson, and an astronaut who wanted the lyrics of a song from a Broadway musical.<br> <br>On which note, I am pleased to hand over to Ben for an expert explanation of the physical mechanics of tears, especially male tears, and to distill perfectly on both our behalves the purpose, as we see it, of this book.<br> BEN HOLDEN<p></p> <br>Cecil Day-Lewis once said that he did not write poetry to be understood, but to understand. This quest, to understand, takes many routes but is common to us all. Tears also unite us as humans: we are the only species that cries. Charles Darwin himself was at a loss to explain this uniquely human trait, describing it as that &#x201c;special expression of man&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>One scientific explanation is that the act of crying is evolution&#x2019;s mechanism for draining excess chemicals released into the blood when we experience extreme stress or high emotion: the chin&#x2019;s mentalis muscle wobbles; a lump rises in our throat, as the autonomic nervous system expands the glottis to aid our oxygen intake; the lachrymal glands flood the fornix conjunctiva of the upper eyelid; and, as teardrops break their ducts and run down our cheeks, our blood is cleansed of the secreted prolactin and adrenocorticotropic hormones.<br> <br>Put another way: we have &#x201c;a good cry&#x201d; and feel better.<br> <br>An alternative theory is that crying is an advancement of a mammalian distress signal. After all, tears provide a clear and immediate cry for help that is tricky to fake. And just as it is tough to counterfeit, crying can also be catching, like yawning. One person&#x2019;s tears often set off another&#x2019;s.<br> <br>In these ways, weeping betrays not only vulnerability but also an openness that is contagious. Yet so often we try to hide our tears when caught out or in public, as if it is embarrassing to be around such raw tenderness. This is perhaps especially true for those of us who are men.<br> <br>Despite the male tear duct being larger than the female, studies have consistently shown that from around the age of ten a divergence occurs and thereafter boys cry far less than girls. Whether that is down to cultural or biological reasons (or, as is likely the case, both), the sad truth is that the male of our species has not always been allowed to cry. Tears may have been venerated in European cultures during the nineteenth century as a sign of high moral character but, these days, they are all too hastily wiped away.<br> <br>We want to put paid to that with this anthology. We hope that readers may set each other off as they read these verses aloud to one another. Let&#x2019;s celebrate high emotion! Together let&#x2019;s express our shared humanity, whatever your gender, background, or circumstances. However grievous at times, let these pages console you, if upset; lift you, if down; I defy you not to be inspired by them.<br> <br>To borrow from Samuel Beckett, our contributors&#x2019; &#x201c;words are their tears.&#x201d; Some of their introductions are profoundly moving and many describe devastating ordeals. These woes are framed in personal contexts but will be familiar to many readers. During its compilation, contributor Billy Collins jokingly asked how any of us will make it through the book without succumbing to a complete emotional breakdown. Yet our intent with this collection is to celebrate our shared compassion and common humanity, all in keeping with the creed of our partners at Amnesty International.<br> <br>We hope as you read these pages that your own corneas may at times flood. Crying expresses our very inability to articulate emotion, after all, and so what could be more human, honest, or pure than tears?<br> <br>Perhaps the only response is that other &#x201c;special expression&#x201d; of ours: poetry.</p><h2>You and Me and the Wishing Tree</h2><p><p><i>We woke up in the usual way, </i><br><i>but it was </i>not<i> a usual day.</i><br><i>Out on the lawn, plain as could be, </i><br><i>stood an orange wishing tree.</i><br><i>"I wish!"

Bezmen tells the story of two star-crossed lovers fleeing the wave of devastation wreaked by the Bolshevik Revolution-- and does so with great sensitivity: one half of this couple who sought refuge in the capital of the dying Ottoman Empire was her grandfather. Translated into 12 languages, Kurt Seyt &amp; Shura inspired a sumptuous T.V. series that continues to enchant millions of viewers across the world. With the publication of this novel in the United States, English-speaking fans will now be able to read the true story of this great love affair, which triumphed over so much adversity yet failed to overcome human fallibility. Kurt Seyt: The son of a wealthy Crimean nobleman, is a dashing first lieutenant in the Imperial Life Guard. Injured on the Carpathian front and later sought by the Bolsheviks, he makes a daring escape across the Black Sea. Too proud to accept payment for the boatful of arms he hands over to the Nationalists, he faces years of struggle to make a new life in the Turkish Republic rising from the embers of the dying Ottoman Empire. All he has is his dignity and love. Shura: An innocent sixteen-year-old beauty enchanted by Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s music and Moscow&#x2019;s glittering lights, falls in love with Seyt. A potential victim of the Bolsheviks due to her family&#x2019;s wealth and social standing, she is determined to follow her heart and accompanies Seyt on his perilous flight over the Black Sea. Their love is the only solace to their crushing homesickness for a land and family they will never see again, two lovers among hundreds of thousands of White Russian �migr�s trying to eke out a living in occupied Istanbul.</p><p>Nermin Bezmen is an accomplished artist, art teacher, yoga instructor, and broadcaster whose meticulous research into family history led to the publication of Kurt Seyt &amp; Shura in 1992. This fictionalized account of her grandfather&#x2019;s life became an instant best seller and is now considered a masterpiece of contemporary Turkish literature; in fact, it has reached textbook status in several secondary schools and universities. Exquisite detail distinguishes her writing as she proves that truth is indeed stranger than fiction and that our ancestors call out to us from the pages of history. Her powerful character analysis and storytelling skills invite readers to explore their own dreams, sorrows, anxieties, and even fleeting fancies. Bezmen has published seventeen novels, two of which are biographical and one of which is a fantasy. In addition, she has a children&#x2019;s novel, a collection of short stories, and a book of poems to her credit. She has two children and three grandchildren and lives with her husband, actor Tolga Savac&#x131;, in New Jersey and Istanbul.</p><h2>Teaching People Not Poses: 12 Principles for Teaching Yoga with Integrity</h2><p>In yoga teacher training you are taught how to teach the yoga poses but not necessarily much about the art of teaching.

What will that room be? Will it serve a need that you were not aware of when you first moved in? You might, for instance, have decided that you now need a study or an exercise room. Or will it allow you to elaborate on something that has always been part of your life? Perhaps you have always cared about books and have bookshelves spread throughout your home, but now you want to gather those books together in a room you will call the library. You may not have had a room where a guest could stay but now want to offer hospitality to a married son or daughter with a new generation of children (will one room be enough?). You may want to take an avocation, like wood carving or work you have done for a cause you cared about, and develop it, so the new room will be a studio or an office. You may have become passionate about gourmet cooking and want a different kind of kitchen. Or you may simply want to use this opportunity to extend your traditional &#x201c;living room&#x201d; in some new and more inclusive way, with more space or wider windows or a hearth.<br><br>The first thing you will discover when you &#x201c;add&#x201d; a room to a house is that add is generally the wrong word, because the way you use all the rest of the house, the way you live and organize your time and even your relationships, will be affected by the change. Existing rooms will be used differently, sounds will echo in new ways, community and privacy will have new meanings. Gaps will open where familiar items have been shifted to the new space and new acquisitions will fill them. The new room is not simply tacked on to the east or west side of the house, it represents a new configuration of the entire building and the lives it shelters.<br><br>This is what longevity is like. In the United States, we have not &#x201c;added&#x201d; years to life (thirty in the twentieth century, twenty since World War II), tacked on at the end. We have changed the shape and meaning of a lifetime in ways we do not yet fully understand. Similarly, with increasing numbers of older citizens, we are changing as a population, becoming a rather different society, just as the Louisiana and Alaska purchases brought more than geographical space to the nation. Arguably, something even more profound has happened: we are evolving into a rather different species, inhabiting a new niche and challenged to adapt in new ways. Similar processes are occurring in other industrialized countries, but culture, legislation, and economy make them play out differently, so the examples in this book, drawn from the United States, need to be interpreted in the light of American conditions, particularly the continuing openness to immigration, the lack of mandatory retirement laws, and attitudes toward employment.<br><br>Here is the situation in which we find ourselves. Most Americans are aware that the retirement of the Baby Boom generation is creating a variety of new demands, so that &#x201c;retirement&#x201d; has changed its meaning. In fact, our assumptions about retirement already mask deep changes. Government retirement pensions were invented in Germany at the beginning of the twentieth century, at a time when sixty-five-year-olds were few and far between (life expectancy at birth was about forty-five), were mostly very limited in their ability to work, and would not be around for long. In other words, retirement was invented for people whose conditions were in some ways worse than those of eighty-five-year-olds in the United States today. Today&#x2019;s sixty-five-year-olds are starting new careers or continuing old ones, traveling around the world, and eloping with new loves.<br><br>What is less widely understood is that this is happening at a time when both individual life cycles and populations have taken on radically new structures. We have not added decades to life expectancy by simply extending old age; instead, we have opened up a new space partway through the life course, a second and different kind of adulthood that precedes old age, and as a result every stage of life is undergoing change.<br><br>Different societies look at age-groups differently. In some places status is governed by small differences of age, in others all children or all old people may be grouped together. However, virtually every society does make distinctions between children and adults and does recognize changes in the participation of older adults, creating at least three major stages of life, which may be subdivided further, stages that ? cor?respond for many individuals to generations: childhood (not yet adults), parenthood (adults), and grandparenthood (elders). With the survival of many grandparents to become great-grandparents and the improved health conditions of older adults, we have in effect created the first four-generation society in history.<br><br>Here I am not using the term <i>generation</i> to refer to twenty-year cohorts with catchy nicknames, although cohorts do indeed share characteristics determined by the changing contexts in which they have grown up and lived. I am referring to the presence of three coexisting generations defined by their roles and activities, with individuals moving from one to the next as &#x201c;the younger generation&#x201d; becomes &#x201c;the older generation&#x201d; around the campfire or the table; children become parents, and parents become grandparents, often by about the age of forty, which was regarded as a fairly ripe old age through most of human history. Today&#x2019;s grandparents, including a considerable proportion of Baby Boomers, are different from grandparents in the past and much healthier and more numerous.<br><br>This is new. Every society has some members who are not yet full participants&#x2014;infants, children, and those approaching adulthood, whom we now call adolescents. And every society has adults who are simultaneously full participants in maintaining the society and in its perpetuation as they produce and rear children. And every society has at least a few older members who are past their reproductive and child-rearing years, often in declining health. This older generation typically withdraws from some kinds of participation, but the pattern always includes some continuing contribution, often of a sort that is not open to younger adults.<br><br>We know from cross-cultural studies that postreproductive adults&#x2014;elders&#x2014;have played a key role in human societies through time. Many of these elders have been grandparents and a few have been great-grandparents (a very scarce resource through most of history), but in terms of the ancient three-generation structure, they have played similar roles. This has been the human pattern: three generations or stages of life, diverse and changing through time, defined in relation to the others and to their forms of participation and only secondarily as age-groups.<br><br>Now, however, older adults, many of whom are grandparents but who have an unprecedented level of health and energy, time and resources, fit into society in new ways, often much like younger adults. And for the first time in history there are large numbers of great- grandparents, who look and act somewhat, but not precisely, the way grandparents used to. Biomedicine has once again created a profound change in the human condition. We have inserted a new developmental stage into the life cycle, a second stage of adulthood, not an extension tacked on to old age.<br><br>A decade ago some of us began calling this stage a second adulthood, but that phrase too easily evokes the second rate or secondhand&#x2014;or even a second childhood of incompetence. I think we will need to think in terms of a first adult stage we can call Adulthood I, a very busy and productive time, which includes both our primary child-rearing years and the building of careers, and a new stage we can call Adulthood II. Adulthood II may begin as early as age forty (for example, for athletes, whose first careers may last only twenty years) and extend past eighty (for example, for politicians, if they reach the Senate, and many self-employed people), for many years of participation and contribution. Both as individuals and as a society we are being taken by surprise by this change, yet so far most of the discussion focuses on its financial implications, not on its opportunities. How will the new room be used? How will the rest of life be different?<br><br>Those who are grandparents today are unlike the grandparents they remember. They adore their grandchildren, but they just aren&#x2019;t sitting still. They won&#x2019;t behave like stereotypical grandparents, with long memories and short walks, until they are great-grandparents. They are often colleagues to their own children, working side by side as adults. Historically, wisdom has been associated with elders. Today&#x2019;s grandparents combine the same length of experience with continuing mobility, so I think of Adulthood II as the stage of active wisdom, which precedes old age.<br><br>We are going through a profound change in the status of the human species. The easiest way to assess that change is to consider the importance of an extended childhood in the process of becoming human, <i>Homo sapiens</i>. From very simple organisms up through mammals, learning very slowly became a key to survival; most organisms are hatched or born equipped with the specialized behaviors they need to survive in their environments, or can acquire them in a matter of days or weeks, without an extended period of dependency. Human development, by comparison, is exceptionally labor intensive, requiring the attention of multiple adults over long periods of time. Even in comparison to other mammals, human infants and children are helpless in a way that is conspicuous and seems terribly inefficient. But it is this helplessness that is the key not only to the flexibility that has allowed humans to adapt to every environment on the planet but also to the long adventure of exploration and invention that we call culture. Even more important, it is what prepares human beings to give and receive love and is the seedbed of conscience.<br><br>For humans, even the most rudimentary skills of survival must be transmitted from generation to generation early in the life course. Transmitting even a fraction of the larger culture requires a period of enculturation that now lasts twenty or more years and often continues to the end of life. It seems that the experiences of helplessness, depen?- dence, and vulnerability are essential to becoming human. Human infants have no option of walking or flying away after a few weeks or months but willy-nilly are forced to stay with caregivers, normally creating the context for learning, along with an array of information and skills, how to love and how to trust.<br><br>When we look at aging from a Darwinian perspective, it is clear that the same apparent anomaly exists at the end of life. If the hen is the egg&#x2019;s way of making another egg, the hen that is no longer laying is useless except for the stewpot. In many species, the spider lays her eggs and dies&#x2014;she has made her contribution to the future (and sometimes she kills her mate, his contribution also completed). Yet even as natural selection has reinforced a period of dependent learning for the survival of offspring in some species, natural selection apparently reinforces the possibility for elders in some species to live on while their young mature, sometimes to produce another brood, and sometimes beyond that capacity as well.<br><br>Studies of species that live in groups, where members of the pack or herd tend to be related&#x2014;for instance, a herd of deer&#x2014;have shown that the survival of a few postreproductive animals, in this case a few old does, increases the chance of survival of young born in the herd, because the old does remember where to find food or water in a year of drought or very deep snow, contributing to the inclusive fitness of the group. Human society is conspicuous for the role played by adults other than parents in the rearing of the young&#x2014;in fact, teaching is more distinctively human than learning, as is the institutionalization of teaching roles. Anthropologists have looked at human groups and demonstrated that the presence of grandparents&#x2014;particularly maternal grandmothers&#x2014;reduces infant and child mortality, which is to say, increases the likelihood that children will grow up to pass on their genes, presumably the same genes that kept their grandparents healthy and supportive. And here, too, love and trust must be part of the equation, particularly the trust between a new mother and her own mother, which allows her to accept help and advice more easily than from a mother-in-law.<br><br>Most human groups value their elders, and a great many societies have evolved specialized and valued roles for the old, some of them depending on obvious assets, like length of experience, and others involving more subtle values. Among the San Bushmen of southern Africa, for instance, the hunt for game with poison-tipped arrows depends on moving rapidly across the veld, first to approach the quarry and then to follow for several days as the poison does its work. When men become too old to participate in the hunt, they become the makers of arrows&#x2014;and tradition ascribes to the arrow maker the primary credit for the kill, so that in the distribution of meat to all the members of the community, the arrow maker is treated as the source. Looked at pragmatically, the making of the arrow is indeed a contribution, one that could be made by a younger man but has been reserved for the old, but less of a concrete contribution than the honor it is given, which makes it central to the solidarity of the band. Similarly, only when women are too old for childbearing are they permitted to become shamanic healers, a translation of the love and care they have given their children to the health of the wider community. In both cases, an appropriately limited effort is recognized as having a profound value.</p><h2>Dragon Rises, Red Bird Flies: Psychology &amp; Chinese Medicine (Revised Edition)</h2><p>Behind the acupuncture, herbal remedies and sophisticated diagnostics of Chinese medicine lies a &#x201c;congenial system of healing that embodies unification of body and mind, spirit and matter, nature and man, philosophy and reality.&#x201d; In this comprehensive and ground-breaking presentation, based on long experience as physician, psychiatrist, and practitioner of Chinese medicine, Leon Hammer offers a new model for appreciating the traditional healer&#x2019;s effective and profound respect for individual integrity and energetic balance. Explaining, and moving beyond, the five phase (element) system, he shows that this Eastern practice is as much a spiritual science as a physical one. Accessible to the layman, yet a resource for the professional in any healing art, this book examines the natural energy functions of the human organism as a key to mental, emotional and spiritual health. It offers new insight into disease, showing how it is not merely an invasion from the outside, but rather a byproduct of a person&#x2019;s unsuccessful attempt to restore one&#x2019;s own balance.</p><p>Leon I. Hammer, M.D. is a graduate of Cornell University, Cornell Medical College, and the William A. White Institute of Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry. During the early 1970s he studied Chinese medicine in England with Dr. Richard Van Buren, and then apprenticed for eight years in New York and Massachusetts with Dr. John H.F. Shen, a widely recognized master of Chinese pulse diagnosis. Dr. Hammer practiced Chinese medicine until 1990, when he began teaching pulse workshops in the United States and abroad. He is the author of <i>Dragon Rises, Redbird Flies</i>, a study of the relationship between Chinese medicine and Western psychology, and is president of the Dragon Rises School of Oriental Medicine in Gainesville, Florida.Hammer argues cogently for a cause well worth taking seriously by health professionals and the public at large. --Publishers Weekly<br><br>Dr. Hammer has brought new light to the depths of Chinese medicine. --Ted J.

This research-driven, strategy-based media writing textbook digs deeply into how media professionals think and write in journalism, public relations, advertising, and other forms of strategic communication. Authors Scott A. Kuehn and Andrew Lingwall have created two comprehensive writing models to help students overcome their problems in finding and developing story topics by giving them "starting points" to begin writing. The Professional Strategy Triangle model shows students how to think critically about the audience, the situation, and the message before starting a news story or persuasive piece and the FAJA four-point model asks students a series of questions about their story type (Fact, Analysis, Judgment, or Action) to guide them to the right angle or organizational structure for their message. Rooted in classical rhetorical methods, this step-by-step technique enables readers to strategically approach each writing task, no matter the format.</p></p><p><p><strong>Scott Kuehn, Ph.D.</strong> - is Professor of Communication at Clarion University of Pennsylvania.

I made the trip from Pasterway on a regular basis, as I had affairs to monitor in the city. Those trips, however, were not well-publicized&#x2014;by which I mean I mentioned them to only a handful of people, all of them discreet. So far as most of Scirland knew (those few who cared to know), I was a recluse, and had been so since my return from Vystrana. <br>I was permitted reclusiveness on account of my personal troubles, though in reality I spent more of my time on work: first the publication of our Vystrani research, and then preparation for this Erigan expedition, which had been delayed and delayed again, by forces far beyond our control. On that Graminis morning, however, I could no longer escape the social obligations I assiduously buried beneath those other tasks. The best I could do was to discharge them both in quick succession: to visit first my blood relations, and then those bound to me by marriage. <br>My house in Pasterway was only a short drive from the fashionable district of Havistow, where my eldest brother Paul had settled the prior year. I usually escaped the necessity of visiting his house by the double gift of his frequent absence and his wife&#x2019;s utter disinterest in me, but on this occasion I had been invited, and it would have been more trouble to refuse. <br>Please understand, it is not that I disliked my family. Most of us got on cordially enough, and I was on quite good terms with Andrew, the brother most immediately senior to me. But the rest of my brothers found me baffling, to say the least, and my mother&#x2019;s censure of my behaviour had nudged their opinions toward disapproval. What Paul wanted with me that day I did not know&#x2014;but on the whole, I would have preferred to face a disgruntled Vystrani rock-wyrm. <br>Alas, those were all quite far away, while my brother was too near to avoid. With a sensation of girding for battle, I lifted my skirt in ladylike delicacy, climbed the front steps, and rang the bell. <br>My sister-in-law was in the morning room when the footman escorted me in. Judith was a paragon of upper-class Scirling wifehood, in all the ways I was not: beautifully dressed, without crossing the line into gyver excess; a gracious hostess, facilitating her husband&#x2019;s work by social means; and a dedicated mother, with three children already, and no doubt more to come. <br>We had precisely one thing in common, which was Paul. &#x201c;Have I called at the wrong time?&#x201d; I inquired, after accepting a cup of tea. <br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; Judith answered. &#x201c;He is not at home just now&#x2014;a meeting with Lord Melst&#x2014;but you are welcome to stay until he returns.&#x201d; <br>Lord Melst? Paul <i>was</i> moving up in the world. &#x201c;I presume this is Synedrion business,&#x201d; I said. <br>Judith nodded. &#x201c;We had a short respite after he won his chair, but now the affairs of government have moved in to occupy his time. I hardly expect to see him between now and Gelis.&#x201d; <br>Which meant I might be cooling my heels here for a very long time. &#x201c;If it is not too much trouble,&#x201d; I said, putting down my teacup and rising from my seat, &#x201c;I think it might be better for me to leave and come back. I have promised to pay a visit to my brother-in-law Matthew today as well.&#x201d; <br>To my surprise, Judith put out her hand to stop me. &#x201c;No, please stay. We have a guest right now, who was hoping to see you&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>I never had the chance to ask who the guest was, though I had my suspicions the moment Judith began to speak. The door to the sitting room opened, and my mother came in. <br>Now it all made sense. I had ceased to answer my mother&#x2019;s letters some time before, for my own peace of mind. She would not, even when asked, leave off criticizing my every move, and implying that my bad judgment had caused me to lose my husband in Vystrana. It was not courteous to ignore her, but the alternative would be worse. For her to see me, therefore, she must either show up unannounced at my house&nbsp;&#x2026; or lure me to another&#x2019;s. <br>Such logic did little to sweeten my reaction. Unless my mother was there to offer reconciliation&#x2014;which I doubted&#x2014;this was a trap. I had rather pull my own teeth out than endure more of her recriminations. (And lest you think that a mere figure of speech, I should note that I <i>did</i> once pull my own tooth out, so I do not make the comparison lightly.) <br>As it transpired, though, her recriminations were at least drawing on fresh material. My mother said, &#x201c;Isabella. What is this nonsense I hear about you going to Eriga?&#x201d; <br>I have been known to bypass the niceties of small talk, and ordinarily I am grateful for it in others. In this instance, however, it had the effect of an arrow shot from cover, straight into my brain. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I said, quite stupidly&#x2014;not because I failed to understand her, but because I had no idea how she had come to hear of it. <br>&#x201c;You know perfectly well what I mean,&#x201d; she went on, relentlessly. &#x201c;It is <i>absurd,</i> Isabella. You cannot go abroad again, and <i>certainly</i> not to any part of Eriga. They are at war there!&#x201d; <br>I sought my chair once more, using the delay to regain my composure. &#x201c;That is an exaggeration, Mama, and you know it. Bayembe is not at war. The mansa of Talu dares not invade, not with Scirling soldiers helping to defend the borders.&#x201d; <br>My mother sniffed. &#x201c;I imagine the man who drove the Akhians out of Elerqa&#x2014;after two hundred years!&#x2014;dares a great deal indeed. And even if <i>he</i> does not attack, what of those dreadful Ikwunde?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The entire jungle of Mouleen lies between them and Bayembe,&#x201d; I said, irritated. &#x201c;Save at the rivers, of course, and Scirland stands guard there as well. Mama, the whole point of our military presence is to make the place safe.&#x201d; <br>The look she gave me was dire. &#x201c;Soldiers do not make a place safe, Isabella. They only make it less dangerous.&#x201d; <br>What skill I have in rhetoric, I inherited from my mother. I was in no mood to admire her phrasing that day, though. Nor to be pleased at her political awareness, which was quite startling. Most Scirling women of her class, and a great many men, too, could barely name the two Erigan powers that had forced Bayembe to seek foreign&#x2014;which is to say Scirling&#x2014;aid. Gentlemen back then were interested only in the lopsided &#x201c;trade agreement&#x201d; that sent Bayembe iron to Scirland, along with other valuable resources, in exchange for them allowing us to station our soldiers all over their country, and build a colony in Nsebu. Ladies were not interested much at all. <br>Was this something she had attended to before, or had she educated herself upon hearing of my plans? Either way, this was not how I had intended to break the news to her. Just how I <i>had</i> intended to do it, I had not yet decided; I kept putting off the issue, out of what I now recognized as rank cowardice. And this was the consequence: an unpleasant confrontation in front of my sister-in-law, whose stiffly polite expression told me that she had known this was coming. <br>(A sudden worm of suspicion told me that Paul, too, had known. Meeting with Lord Melst, indeed. Such a <i>shame</i> he was out when I arrived.) <br>It meant, at least, that I only had to face my mother, without allies to support her in censure. I was not fool enough to think I would have had allies of my own. I said, &#x201c;The Foreign Office would not allow people to travel there, let alone settle, if it were so dangerous as all that. And they <i>have</i> been allowing it, so there you are.&#x201d; She did not need to know that one of the recurrent delays in this expedition had involved trying to persuade the Foreign Office to grant us visas. &#x201c;Truly, Mama, I shall be at far more risk from malaria than from any army.&#x201d; <br>What possessed me to say that, I do not know, but it was sheer idiocy on my part. My mother&#x2019;s glare sharpened. &#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; she said, and the word could have frosted glass. &#x201c;Yet you propose to go to a place teeming with tropical diseases, without a single <i>thought</i> for your son.&#x201d; <br>Her accusation was both fair and not. It was true that I did not think as much of my son as one might expect. I gave very little milk after his birth and had to hire a wet-nurse, which suited me all too well; infant Jacob reminded me far too much of his late namesake. Now he was more than two years old, weaned, and in the care of a nanny. My marriage settlement had provided quite generously for me, but much of that money I had poured into scientific research, and the books of our Vystrani expedition&#x2014;the scholarly work under my husband&#x2019;s name, and my own inane bit of travel writing&#x2014;were not bringing in as much as one might hope. Out of what remained, however, I paid handsomely for someone to care for my son, and not because the widow of a baronet&#x2019;s second son ought not to stoop to such work herself. I simply did not know what to do with Jacob otherwise. <br>People often suppose that maternal wisdom is wholly instinctual: that however ignorant a woman may be of child rearing prior to giving birth, the mere fact of her sex will afterward endow her with perfect capability. This is not true even on the grossest biological level, as the failure of my milk had proved, and it is even less true in social terms. In later years I have come to understand children from the perspective of a natural historian; I know their development, and have some appreciation for its marvellous progress. But at that point in time, little Jacob made less sense to me than a dragon. <br>Is the rearing of a child best performed by a woman who has done it before, who has honed her skills over the years and enjoys her work, or by a woman with no skill and scant enjoyment, whose sole qualification is a direct biological connection? My opinion fell decidedly on the former, and so I saw very little practical reason why I should not go to Eriga. In <i>that</i> respect, I had given a great deal of thought to the matter of my son. <br>Saying such things to my mother was, however, out of the question. Instead I temporized. &#x201c;Matthew Camherst and his wife have offered to take him in while I am gone. Bess has one of her own, very near the same age; it will be good for Jacob to have a companion.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And if you die?&#x201d; <br>The question dropped like a cleaver onto the conversation, severing it short. I felt my cheeks burning: with anger, or with shame&#x2014;likely both. I was outraged that my mother should say such a thing so bluntly&nbsp;&#x2026; and yet my husband had died in Vystrana. It was not impossible that I should do the same in Eriga. <br>Into this dead and bleeding silence came a knock on the door, followed shortly by the butler, salver in hand, bowing to present a card to Judith, who lifted it, mechanically, as if she were a puppet and someone had pulled the string on her arm. Confusion carved a small line between her brows. &#x201c;Who is Thomas Wilker?&#x201d; <br>The name had the effect of a low, unnoticed kerb at the edge of a street, catching my mental foot and nearly causing me to fall on my face. &#x201c;Thomas Wil&#x2014;what is <i>he</i> doing here?&#x201d; Comprehension followed, tardily, lifting me from my stumble. Judith did not know him, and neither did my mother, which left only one answer. &#x201c;Ah. I think he must be here to see me.&#x201d; <br>Judith&#x2019;s posture snapped to a rigid, upright line, for this was <i>not</i> how social calls were conducted. A man should not inquire after a widow in a house that wasn&#x2019;t hers. I spared a moment to notice that the card, which Judith dropped back on the salver, was not a proper calling card; it appeared to be a piece of paper with Mr. Wilker&#x2019;s name written in by hand. Worse and worse. Mr. Wilker was not, properly speaking, a gentleman, and certainly not the sort of person who would call here in the normal course of things. <br>I did what I could to retrieve the moment. &#x201c;I do apologize. Mr. Wilker is an assistant to the earl of Hilford&#x2014;you recall him, of course; he is the one who arranged the Vystrani expedition.&#x201d; And was arranging the Erigan one, too, though his health precluded him from accompanying us. But what business of that could be so urgent that Lord Hilford would send Mr. Wilker after me at my brother&#x2019;s house? &#x201c;I should speak with him, but there&#x2019;s no need to trouble you. I will take my leave.&#x201d; <br>My mother&#x2019;s outstretched hand stopped me before I could stand. &#x201c;Not at all. I think we&#x2019;re all eager to hear what this Mr. Wilker has to say.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Judith said faintly, obeying the unspoken order woven through my mother&#x2019;s words. &#x201c;Send him in, Londwin.&#x201d; <br>The butler bowed and retired. By the alacrity with which Mr. Wilker appeared, he must have sprang forward the instant he was welcomed in; agitation still showed in his movements. But he had long since taken pains to cultivate better manners than those he had grown up with, and so he presented himself first to Judith. &#x201c;Good morning, Mrs. Hendemore. My name is Thomas Wilker. I&#x2019;m sorry to trouble you, but I have a message for Mrs. Camherst. We must have passed one another on the road; I only just missed her at her house. And I&#x2019;m afraid the news is unfortunate enough that it could not wait. I was told she would be visiting here.&#x201d; <br>The curt, disjointed way in which he delivered these words made my hands tighten in apprehension. Mr. Wilker was, quite rightly, looking only at Judith, save a brief nod when he spoke my name; with no hint forthcoming from him, I found myself exchanging a glance instead with my mother. <br>What I saw there startled me. <i>We&#x2019;re all eager to hear what this Mr. Wilker has to say</i>&#x2014;she thought he was my lover! An overstatement, perhaps, but she had the expression of a woman looking for signs of inappropriate attachment, and coming up empty-handed. <br>As well she should. Mr. Wilker and I might no longer be at loggerheads the way we had been in Vystrana, but I felt no romantic affection for him, nor he for me. Our relationship was purely one of business. <br>I wanted to set my mother down in no uncertain terms for harboring such thoughts, but forbore. Not so much because of the sheer inappropriateness of having that conversation in public, but because it occurred to me that Mr. Wilker and I were engaged in <i>two</i> matters of business, of which the Erigan expedition was only one. <br>Judith, fortunately, waved Mr. Wilker on before I could burst out with my questions unbidden. &#x201c;By all means, Mr. Wilker. Or is your message private?&#x201d; <br>I would not have taken the message privately for a hundred sovereigns, not with such suspicions in my mother&#x2019;s mind. &#x201c;Please,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What has happened?&#x201d; <br>Mr. Wilker blew out a long breath, and the urgency drained from him in a sudden rush, leaving him sagging and defeated. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a break-in at Kemble&#x2019;s.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Kemble&#x2019;s&nbsp;&#x2026; oh, no.&#x201d; My own shoulders sagged, a mirror to his. &#x201c;What did they destroy? Or&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>He nodded, grimly. &#x201c;Took. His notes.&#x201d; <br>Theft, not destruction. Someone knew what Kemble was working on, and was determined to steal it for their own. <br>I slumped back in my chair, ladylike dignity the furthest thing from my mind. Frederick Kemble was the chemist Mr. Wilker had hired&#x2014;or rather <i>I</i> had hired; the money was mine, although the choice of recipient was his&#x2014;to continue the research we ourselves had stolen in the mountains of Vystrana, three years ago. Research that documented a method for preserving dragonbone: an amazing substance, strong and light, but one that decayed quickly outside a living body. <br>The Chiavoran who developed that method was not the first one ...</p><h2>Look to the Mountain: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>The million-copy bestselling novel of the New England frontier</strong></p> One of the most popular and enduring novels of the last century, <em>Look to the Mountain</em> is the epic story of two young settlers who start a new life in the foothills of New Hampshire's White Mountains on the eve of the American Revolution.

Frenete is careful to keep his language inclusive, further opening the door to those who wish to explore rather than follow. Consider displaying this one with Father Keating's book and with The Cloud of Unknowing, one of the foundation texts of Centering Prayer.&#x201d; &#x2015;Anna Jedrziewski, Retailing Insight</p><p>&#x201c;Frenette's enthusiasm for centering prayer, his use of illustrative material from his own life and mystical experiences, and his flair for creativity give this handbook a vibrancy that carries the reader along.

From this place of wisdom, David enlightens readers with encouragement and enrichment, which will nourish them in their own commitment to the centering prayer practice and the contemplative life.&#x201d; &#x2015;Gail Fitzpatrick-Hopler, President of Contemplative Outreach, Ltd.</p><p>&#x201c;"This book has three qualities that make it so helpful to read. First, David Frenette is clearly speaking out of his experience of centering prayer as a path to God. This experiential voice cuts through theoretical explanations and helps us come to our own intimate desire to experience God&#x2019;s presence in our lives. Second, his frequent references to The Cloud of Unknowing and other classical texts of mystic teachers bear witness to this book&#x2019;s fidelity to the ancient and timeless wisdom of contemplative Christianity. And third, David guides us along the contemplative path in an inviting and accessible style&#x2015;well suited to both sincere beginners and to those who are more well-seasoned in following the interior path that David Frenette invites us to follow.&#x201d; &#x2015;James Finley, PhD, Core Teacher of the Center for Action and Contemplation</p></p><h2>Fragile Eternity (Wicked Lovely, Book 3)</h2><p><p><strong>In the third mesmerizing tale in Melissa Marr&#x2019;s #1 <em>New York Times </em>bestselling Wicked Lovely series, old friends become new enemies&#x2014;and one wrong move could plunge the Earth into chaos.</strong></p><p>Seth never expected he would want to settle down with anyone, but that was before Aislinn.

Aislinn, who became a faerie in the first book, now has to deal with the awkward--verging on impossible--position of still being in love with her mortal boyfriend Seth, whom she can't even touch without burning. To complicate things further, as the new Summer Queen, Aislinn is eternally bonded to Keenan, the Summer King, and the attraction between them is palpable and constant. In the doomed loves that permeate these books, Marr deftly explores the essence of longing as she questions notions of fated love. Her characters are strong, with even the nastiest of the faerie troublemakers coming through as absolutely compelling and sympathetic. And their situations are rife with conflict, from the impossible mortal-faerie relationships to the ancient familial and courtly spats within the faerie realm. In the hands of a less talented writer, these complexities could easily veer into soap opera, but Marr's dark sensibility imbues the series with an eerie, sexy, mysterious ambience that gives it just the edge it needs. <i>--Heidi Broadhead</i><p>Seth wants to be with Aislinn forever.

Experience true spiritual transformation: invite God&#x2019;s presence into your life! Popular author, theologian, and pastor Gregory Boyd shows you how&#x2014;simply, practically, and effectively&#x2014;in this thoughtful and accessible book. Discover: � How to pray continually � What it means to &#x201c;take every thought captive&#x201d; � How to wake up to God&#x2019;s ever-present love God is closer to you than the air you breathe. He is present in every given moment. Wake up to his presence! Turn off the mental chatter that keeps you from seeing his glory. Embrace the holy habit of inviting God&#x2019;s presence into your life, and be transformed! Wake Up to God&#x2019;s Presence! We long to be transformed. Yet our minds are filled with endless trivia and self-centered chatter. To-do lists. Worries about the past. Speculation about the future. We forget to live in the present moment ... and to invite God to be with us there. After reading classic contemplative authors Brother Lawrence, Jean-Pierre de Caussade, and Frank Laubach, theologian and pastor Gregory Boyd longed to experience the presence of God for himself. For two decades, he&#x2019;s attempted to implement the &#x201c;practice of the presence of God&#x201d; in his own life ... sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing. What he&#x2019;s learned as a fellow pilgrim on his spiritual journey can help you find true spiritual transformation as you begin to practice the discipline of inviting God into every moment. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve become absolutely convinced that remaining aware of God&#x2019;s presence moment-by-moment is the single most important task in the life of every follower of Jesus,&#x201d; Boyd writes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m convinced this challenge is implied in our commitment to surrender our life to Christ, for the only real life we have to surrender to him is the one we live moment-by-moment.&#x201d; Join Boyd on this transformational journey of a lifetime!</p></p><p><p>Gregory A.

Now, with Present Perfect, he will become a voice of sound spiritual wisdom. By (re)introducing the idea of constant awareness of God, Boyd challenges each of us to develop a Christ-consciousness. This book should be on the shelf of anyone who wants to have a deeper prayer life.' -- Tony Jones<br><br>'A dazzling reminder that the Christian life is not just about going up when we die, but about bringing God's kingdom down. Brother Greg offers a fiery and thoughtful invitation to see that eternity begins now, and that Jesus did not simply come to prepare us to die, but to teach us to live. Read it, and hear the invitation to join God's little infection of grace and goodness that is spreading across the globe.' -- Shane Claiborne<br><br>&#x201c;Greg Boyd has a marvelous knack for sensing what is essential for the times in which we live.

With a few squiggles in a simple square, these clever drawings created absurd scenes like "Ship arriving too late to save a drowning witch" (used by Frank Zappa as an album cover), "Octopus signaling for a left turn" and "Clam with buck teeth." And they were all the creation of one brilliant and unpredictable man: Roger Price.<br><br>At the height of their popularity in the mid-1950s, fans enjoyed the Droodles TV show, a Droodles daily newspaper column, Droodles magazine features, Droodles cocktail napkins, even Droodles in ads for Lucky Strike cigarettes. Like hula hoops, drive-in movies and UFOs, Droodles were one of the biggest fads of the 1950s. <br><br>Now Droodles make their triumphant return to delight a new generation that can use some laughs. The Ultimate Droodles Compendium includes every one of Roger Price's 352 most famous Droodles in delightful new full-quality reproductions, with Price's inspired text and quirky footnotes. There's more: a Roger Price/Droodles reminiscence by beloved media critic Leonard Maltin, a full history of Roger Price and Droodles by Emmy-winning writer Fritz Holznagel, and comments from comedy legend Carl Reiner, Boing Boing's Mark Frauenfelder and Carla Sinclair, and others.<br><br>Droodles are back in this handsome, hilarious, ultimate collection from Tallfellow Press. Droodles now. Droodles forever!</p><p>Roger Price's Droodles books sold more than 1 million copies between its debut in 1953 and his death in 1990. His Mad Libs have sold more than 150 million copies (and counting!) since he co-created them with Leonard Stern in 1958. Price's career was packed with other landmarks: touring Europe with Bob Hope, appearing with Steve Allen on the original Tonight Show, doing standup comedy at the Village Vanguard and publishing the cultural critiques In One Head and Out the Other and The Great Roob Revolution. Always funny and often provocative, Price was one of America's most original comic voices.<br><br>Leonard Maltin is one of the world&#x2019;s most respected film critics and historians. He is best known for his widely-used reference work Leonard Maltin&#x2019;s Movie Guide and for his 30-year run on TV's Entertainment Tonight. His books include The 151 Best Movies You&#x2019;ve Never Seen, Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons, The Great Movie Comedians, and Leonard Maltin&#x2019;s Movie Encyclopedia. He holds court at leonardmaltin.com and does a weekly podcast: Maltin on Movies.<br><br>Fritz Holznagel is the Emmy-winning writer of the CBS special A Claymation Easter Celebration and the co-creator of the groundbreaking online encyclopedia Who2. He has written for digital media from The Dictionary of American History to Where in the U.S.A. is Carmen SanDiego? and his books include The World Wide Web Top 1000 and Secrets of the Buzzer. A past winner of the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions, he represented the USA at the first-ever Jeopardy! Olympic Tournament.From A Brief History of Roger Price and Droodles:<br><br>All the geometric Americana of the era showed up in Droodles: cigarettes, bowling balls, martini glasses, bow ties and TV antennae. Price was infatuated with and infuriated by television, and Droodles are full of 1950s ad themes like floating soap, marching cigarettes and chlorophyll for fresh breath.<br><br>The text was pure offbeat Price, with an absurdity that was less post-Bob Hope and more pre-Monty Python. A Droodle about the Tower of Pisa somehow turned into an appreciation of the Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida. A Droodle titled Navel Orange Wearing a Bikini Bathing Suit led to a story about Price&#x2019;s Uncle Parker, the garbage collector. (&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t work for the Sanitation Department &#x2015; he just liked to collect garbage.&#x201d;)<br><br>Price&#x2019;s unlikely daily feature appeared in over 100 newspapers nationwide, from the Globe-Times of Amarillo, Texas to the Daily Telegraph of Bluefield, West Virginia. Droodles were popular enough that in the fall of 1953, Simon and Schuster brought out a hardcover collection titled simply Droodles.<br><br>The book cost one dollar and included Price&#x2019;s commentary on dozens of Droodles. Among them were early favorites like Bear Climbing Up the Other Side of a Tree. On the cover was a note from Roger: &#x201c;Buy this book now! It&#x2019;s later than you think!&#x201d; A sequel to the Droodles book, The Rich Sardine, came out the very next year and included classics like Spider Doing a Handstand and Bullets for a Square Shooter. By then, Price was gathering new inspiration from viewer submissions to his very own nationwide Droodles TV show.<br><br>Early in 1954, Price brought Droodles to the NBC daytime show of Garry Moore &#x2015; his old friend from Club Matinee days in Chicago. When 800 letters arrived from viewers in the days after the show, Moore gave Price a contract for 13 more weekly appearances.</p><h2>The Art of Moy Mackay: An inspirational guide to painting with felted fibres &amp; stitch</h2><p><b>From inspiration and design to the finished vibrant picture, learn to become the felt artist you've dreamed of becoming through this third book by bestselling author and renowned felt-maker, Moy Mackay.</b><br><br>The brand new, opulent book by bestselling author and renowned felt-maker, Moy Mackay. This book shows you how to find inspiration - and hone it - for your own felt painting creations, gradually helping you to develop personal and original ideas. For the first time, delve into the catalogue of Moy's beautiful, colourful sketchbooks and photographs and learn about her own design process and influences, through which your own artistic abilities can be ignited and explored. <br><br>In addition, Moy takes you through every step of the felt-making process, including the materials and tools you need, the process itself (which is easier than you'd imagine), and how to put together four fabulous felt paintings of varying subjects - all of which Moy has devised to give you the basic knowledge for eventually designing your own felt creations. There is also guidance on stitching - both hand- and machine-stitching - as well as how to use colour and introduce texture in the form of different fibres and threads. There are numerous examples of Moy's work throughout the book, inspired by the dramatic scenery of the Scottish Borders where she lives and works, providing further inspiration for your own gorgeous felt paintings.</p><p>Since graduating from the Glasgow School of Art in 1990 with a BA (Hons) degree in Design specialising in printed textiles, Moy Mackay has gone on to develop an innovative felting style using merino fleece fibres in the same way that a painter uses brushstrokes, then embellishing them with machine and hand embroidery. She has exhibited her work at numerous exhibitions throughout the UK and also in the US, and she has built up a steadily increasing fan base. Moy works from Wasps Artist's Studios in Selkirk as well as running The Moy Mackay Gallery in Peebles.

Her once-loving husband is hardly ever home. The supermommies on the playground routinely snub her. Her days are spent carpooling and enduring endless games of Candy Land, and at night, most of her orgasms are of the do-it-yourself variety.<br> <br> When a fellow mother is murdered, Kate finds that the unsolved mystery is the most exciting thing to happen in Upchurch, Connecticut, since her neighbors broke ground for a guesthouse and cracked their septic tank. Even though the local police chief warns her that crime-fighting's a job best left to the professionals, Kate launches an unofficial investigation -- from 8:45 to 11:30 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, when her kids are in nursery school.<br> <br> As Kate is drawn deeper into the murdered woman's past, she begins to uncover the secrets and lies behind Upchurch's picket-fence facade -- and considers the choices and compromises all modern women make as they navigate between marriage and independence, small towns and big cities, being a mother and having a life of one's own.</p><p><i>Goodnight Nobody</i> is bestselling author Jennifer Weiner's attempt at writing a mystery, with a healthy dose of the author's chick lit sensibilities thrown in for good measure. While this <i>Desperate Housewives</i> meets <i>Sex in the City</i> murder mystery won't make readers shake in their Manolo Blahniks, it will provide the obligatory humor and compassion to which fans of Weiner's <i>Good in Bed</i>, <i>In Her Shoes</i>, and <i>Little Earthquakes</i> have grown accustomed. <p> Kate Klein is a feisty, charmingly insecure Connecticut housewife who trades in a life of late-night karaoke sing-a-longs and West Village brunches with her best friend Janie for a world of mini-vans and Mommy and Me pilates classes. Life in Upchurch, Connecticut, heats up when Kate discovers picture-perfect wife and mother Kitty Cavanaugh dead on the pickled maple hardwood floor of her recently remodeled kitchen. A former chronicler of celebrity gossip, Kate takes it upon herself to solve the mystery of Kitty's murder and the disappearance of Lexi Hagen-Holdt, another Upchurch supermom. Along the way, the mysteries and disappointments in Kate's personal life begin to unravel, including her marriage to the kind-yet-uptight Ben, and her unresolved crush on Evan McKenna, a former neighbor with whom a one-night tryst ended in disaster. Thrown in for comic relief, and perhaps to show the depth of Weiner's talents as a writer, are Kate's twin boys and adorably sophisticated 5-year old daughter Sophie ("Sophie was sitting on the toilet, applying lipstick and waiting her turn..."). </p><p> <i>Goodnight Nobody</i> is chock full of plot twists and turns which can be overwhelming and superfluous. However, Weiner's charm and grace are usually enough to rescue readers from these moments of confusion, and reaffirm our commitment to this endearing contemporary voice. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>Jennifer Weiner is the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;sixteen&nbsp;books, including&nbsp;<i>Good in Bed</i>,&nbsp;<i>In Her Shoes</i>, and her memoir,&nbsp;<i>Hungry Heart: Adventures in Life, Love, and Writing</i>.&nbsp;A graduate of Princeton University and contributor to the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Opinion section, Jennifer lives with her family in Philadelphia.

She has a PhD from Harvard University in East Asian history.<br>&nbsp;<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p><p>We all want the best for our children, but what does that mean? Robert LeVine, an eminent Harvard anthropologist, determined that parents around the world universally share three goals in raising their children. The first goal is survival and health: Parents want their children to stay alive. For those who live in societies where they can be reasonably sure of being able to meet children&#x2019;s most basic survival needs past infancy, though, the second universal goal is to raise children who will have the basic skills they&#x2019;ll need to sustain themselves economically once they grow up. And finally, there&#x2019;s the goal of self-maximization&#x2014;of raising a socially competent child who possesses the cultural values that are considered important, and who will succeed in that society: <i>a child who will thrive</i>.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know if I would ever have a child. Pregnancy didn&#x2019;t come easily to me, and my husband, David, and I experienced the heartache of infertility before conceiving our first baby. But I always loved children and longed for the day I might become a mother. When I finally became pregnant, survival was a question: I hemorrhaged so severely in my seventh month that doctors told us the pregnancy was in danger. It wasn&#x2019;t until tiny Benjamin was born and safely in my arms, when I looked at his face with his wide brown eyes, mop of black hair, and the puzzled expression that elicited such fierce protectiveness inside me, that I started to think about what kind of parent I would be and how I could best raise a child who would not only survive but also thrive.</p><p>My parents immigrated to the United States from South Korea shortly before I was born in 1968. Growing up in the 1970s in small-town Pennsylvania, I straddled two cultures every day of my childhood. In some ways my parents were very Korean in how they raised us: We used chopsticks at the dinner table; kimchi, seaweed, and rice were staples in our home; I was taught not to call adults by their first names and to behave respectfully toward older relatives. Education was highly valued in our house and we were expected to complete our homework on time and get good grades. Sometimes this felt like a lot of pressure. At the same time, my parents had a broad perspective and were enthusiastic and relaxed about the things my brothers and I wanted to do, whether it was make our own Halloween costumes, pretend to pan for gold in a creek, watch movies for hours with our friends, or eat or read whatever we wanted. When I look back on my childhood, I am actually astounded by how little my parents questioned the things we were doing with our time and where our lives were going, especially since our American small-town childhood was so different from their own.</p><p>They had their worries, as many immigrant families who strongly want their children to thrive in their new society often do. I remember hushed conversations between my mom and dad about whether we were really getting a good education, and get-togethers with other Korean immigrant families where parents exchanged questions about the schools their children were attending as they tried to navigate an alien school system. Sometimes our differences really compounded my self- consciousness about being one of the few Asian-American students in school. But like many American parents of my generation, I find myself looking back with amazement at a degree of freedom and acceptance that seems virtually lost today. Even though my parents always conveyed the value of holding high expectations, they gave us so much time and space to experiment, play, and just be. They were always trying to do their best for us. They believed in our potential to flourish. But they weren&#x2019;t always trying to mold and change us.</p><p>During my twenties I lived in Japan several times, first to study Japanese and then to do research for a doctorate in East Asian history. In a remote village nestled in the mountainous countryside, I met David, who, like me, was a student who had come to Japan to learn the language. When David and I returned to the United States and decided to get married, we also knew that we might eventually be going back to Japan one day and maybe even raising children there. No matter where our children would grow up, though, I knew I loved America. And I knew there were many things from my own Korean-American upbringing and my Jewish-American husband&#x2019;s that would shape our family&#x2019;s life.</p></p><h2>Carmilla: A Critical Edition (Irish Studies)</h2><p>First serialized in the journal "The Dark Blue" and published shortly thereafter in the short story collection In a Glass Darkly, Le Fanu&#x2019;s 1872 vampire tale is in many ways the overlooked older sister of Bram Stoker&#x2019;s more acclaimed Dracula. A thrilling gothic tale, Carmilla tells the story of a young woman lured by the charms of a female vampire. <br><br>This edition includes a student-oriented introduction, tracing the major critical responses to Carmilla, and four interdisciplinary essays by leading scholars who analyze the story from a variety of theoretical perspectives. Ranging from politics to gender, Gothicism to feminism, and nineteenth-century aestheticism to contemporary film studies, these critical yet accessible articles model the diverse ways that scholars can approach a single text. With a glossary, biography, bibliography, and explanatory notes on the text, this edition is ideal for students of Irish and British nineteenth-century literature.</p><p>Kate Costello-Sullivan is Associate Professor of Modern Irish Literature and the Director of the Irish Literature Program in the English department at Le Moyne College. Her articles have appeared in Working Papers in Irish Studies, Postscript: A Journal of Graduate Criticism and Theory and New Hibernia Review."Costello-Sullivan's critical edition of "Carmilla" is particularly welcome as a text for undergraduates.&nbsp; In addition to offering an annotated text of the work, Costello-Sullivan (Le Moyne College) provides a useful, concise introduction to the story, including an overview of major critical approaches."&nbsp; --Highly recommended.

In this book, I outline the exact steps which enabled me to move my own life from one of poverty and drudgery, to one of previously unimaginable wealth, purpose and joy.<br><br> &#x2018;But Magic? I do hope you are joking!&#x2019;<br><br> That&#x2019;s what I would have said, five or ten years ago. I once despised all things &#x2018;New-Age&#x2019;, all these spiritual types and their airy-fairy views, their bad science and their irrational beliefs. <br><br> I had read <i>The Secret</i> and all the Law of Attraction greats, Wallace Wattles, Anthony Robbins, Rhonda Byrne, Napoleon Hill, Esther Hicks and Wayne Dyer. But no matter how closely I followed their instructions for manifesting money, love or happiness, <i>I couldn&#x2019;t make it work.</i><br><br> It was only when I recognised, accepted and finally embraced that what I was doing was actually some kind of <i>Magic</i> that suddenly things began to fall into place. Once I realised that the power came from within <i>me</i>, it was as if the light had suddenly been switched on. I learned how to manifest love and money, but I also learned how to be happy, truly happy.<br><br> If you&#x2019;re jaded by the whole New Age idea of The Laws of Attraction, have become bored by their failure to deliver... this book is for you. It is my intention to lead you by the hand through a marvellous journey of wonder and adventure, teaching you how to change your life, one step at a time. <br><br> Part one of this course, <i>Becoming Magic</i>, lays the groundwork for becoming a magical person, while part two, <i>Doing Magic</i>, offers concrete techniques and instructions for bringing wonderful things into your life. The plan is to build your knowledge slowly, gradually, building on what has gone before, moving on to more complex manifestation techniques only once the basics are mastered. <br><br> So many people fail with Magic and The Law of Attraction because they rush headlong into using techniques, trying to create enormous manifestations, making very simple but crucial mistakes. When they are disappointed, they imagine they have been duped. The sceptics are right. This is all a load of scammy nonsense. And they give up, declaring <i>it just doesn&#x2019;t work.</i> <br><br> I am telling you that it does work. And <i>you can make it work</i>. And this book will show you how.<br><br> My intention is that this book will allow you to become a true creator of your own life, reawakening and rekindling your belief and interest in The Law of Attraction, Manifesting Reality, Cosmic Ordering or whatever you wish to call it.<br><br> I prefer simply to call it <i>Magic.</i></p><p></p><h2>Microhydro: Clean Power from Water (Mother Earth News Wiser Living Series, 13)</h2><p><p><i> Microhydro </i> features the smallest version of the renewable engery technology dubbed the simplest, most reliable and least expensive way to generate power off grid.

Welcome to my very first cookbook. I&#x2019;ve been a chef, a caterer, a lunch lady, a dancer, a runway model, a reality show star, a daytime cooking show host, even an accountant (really!)&#x2014;and now I&#x2019;m a cookbook author. But most of all, I&#x2019;m a simple Southern girl who loves to cook and who cooks to love. What you&#x2019;ve seen on The Chew and Top Chef isn&#x2019;t a gimmick, or an act, or something that ends when the dishes are cleared. That&#x2019;s who I am and what I cook. Food that hugs you. What could be better than that?<br> <br>Now, giving a hug is easy, but making food that hugs requires a little bit of practice, but it&#x2019;s actually easier than most people think&#x2014;and so much more fun! Whether you&#x2019;re starting to cook for the first time or you&#x2019;ve been in the kitchen forever, I&#x2019;m here to give you the techniques, the recipes, and the confidence you need to cook with love.<br> <br>As you&#x2019;ll see, my food comes from all over the place. I draw as much comfort from Italian flavors as I do from Japanese ones. But at the end of the day, much of my inspiration comes from the American South. I grew up in Nashville, Tennessee, home of the Grand Ole Opry and the Titans. But my grandmother&#x2019;s house is my favorite spot in town. Every week of my childhood, I was smothered with a giant food hug at my Granny&#x2019;s Sunday supper. I can&#x2019;t say that I learned how to cook at Granny&#x2019;s side, though. Most of the time when we went to her house for a family meal after church, the closest I came to cooking was making mud pies.<br> <br>Then one afternoon, Granny asked me to help harvest collard greens from the garden. Like any kid, I tried to beg my way out: &#x201c;Really? Do I really have to pick the greens?&#x201d; My complaining didn&#x2019;t get me anywhere, so I relented and did it. I wasn&#x2019;t happy about it. When we sat down to eat, I had to make sure I wasn&#x2019;t asked to pick the greens again and informed everyone, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re eating. I couldn&#x2019;t tell the difference between the greens and the weeds. You might just be eating weeds right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve learned a lot since then: the difference between greens and weeds, the fact that, of course, Granny knew which was which and cooked only the collards, and how much the memories from our Sunday suppers have defined me. Granny&#x2019;s weekly ritual started long before I came around. She was born Freddie Mae Price to Jessie, who came from a family that was spread across South and North Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Jessie had been bought as a slave by the Price family and was among the last to be freed. In her 102 years on this earth, she lived to see generations of change in the South. She also passed on to Granny the depth and breadth of great Southern black cuisine. I wish every person in America could have sat at Granny&#x2019;s table and been transformed by her cooking, warmth, and hospitality. I&#x2019;m writing this book to honor Granny&#x2014;and the women who came before her&#x2014;and to give you a taste of just how much joy can be had in the kitchen and at the table.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m even giving you some of Granny&#x2019;s treasured recipes, like her buttery pound cake and juicy smothered pork chops, and passing on my interpretations of soul food. Sure, I cook my collard greens low and slow, but guess what? I also saut� them quickly and top them with gremolata, an Italian parsley-lemon-garlic mix. And I do a mean French bouillabaisse sauce of fennel and tomatoes to serve with a roasted whole snapper. Yep, I do all that. I&#x2019;ve been cooking professionally for years (and I mean years!) and travelling and eating around the world. I&#x2019;ve discovered that I can draw comfort from all types of cuisines. Here I&#x2019;ve created a collection of my all-time favorites. Sort of an &#x201c;all you&#x2019;ll ever need&#x201d; repertoire of global comfort food. Because it&#x2019;s not the geographic origins of the food that matters, it&#x2019;s the heart you put into it.<br> <br>And the book is about making comfort food good for your heart, too. I never count calories or sacrifice flavor. Instead, I boost flavors by using just the right amount of butter (which I love!) and the ideal cooking technique. I say &#x201c;no&#x201d; to nothing. It&#x2019;s all about moderation. For example, I always make sure that both my pan and the oil are hot enough when cooking cornmeal-crusted Southern fried catfish. That way, the cornmeal doesn&#x2019;t soak up the oil, it just gets super crisp in it. My dishes end up being naturally nutritious. My goal is to create the most delicious, comforting dishes possible, but I&#x2019;m also always thinking of ways to lighten ultrarich soul food classics and other soulful hearty favorites. It&#x2019;s a way of bringing out the fresh, natural flavors in great ingredients, but my motivation hits closer to home.<br> <br>While living abroad, I received a call and found out that my mama was seriously ill. I flew home right away and was relieved to find that her emergency surgery had been a success. Since that experience, I&#x2019;m constantly tinkering with dishes to make them lighter, healthier for Mama. Even when I started my first &#x201c;professional&#x201d; cooking company, delivering lunches using a retired mail truck and sheer grit in getting my food out through rain, sleet, and snow, I was providing options far superior to the surrounding fast foods, both in flavor and nutrition. With my company, The Lunch Basket (which I later renamed The Lunch Bunch), I became the lunch lady of Kennedy Street in Washington, D.C., a primarily African American neighborhood with lots of beauty salons, barber shops, florists, and doctors&#x2019; offices.<br> <br>Even though I didn&#x2019;t realize it at the time, my decision then to not use beef or pork (though some of my recipes here do) came from a desire to show people how tasty food could be without those things. I stuffed my biscuits with lean smoked turkey and put together fresh green salads, seasonal fruit, and rich veggie soups. At the end of the day, I&#x2019;m giving you delicious fresh food&#x2014;whole ingredients, lovingly prepared. I&#x2019;m making dishes good for my family, in every sense of the word, and I&#x2019;m here to help you do the same for your family and friends, too.<br> <br>The act of cooking for and feeding loved ones yummy wholesome food is deeply fulfilling. I didn&#x2019;t completely understand that until I was an adult well into my food career. I went through a heart-wrenching breakup (boyfriend left me for best friend&#x2014;you know the story), so I poured myself into my lunch business to shield myself from the pain. By cooking for others, I was nurturing them with food, and in turn, felt nurtured myself. I expanded the lunch business into a catering company and called it Alchemy Caterers, because I needed it to change my life, to turn the lead in my hurt into gold. I wanted my food to do the same for others and be a conduit for healing. I don&#x2019;t know exactly what you need right now, but I do know that there&#x2019;s comfort in food. Alchemy is all about transformation, and I want to change the way you experience food by cooking with love.<br> <br>The only way you can make transformative food, even if it&#x2019;s one of the simple dishes in here, is to cook it from the heart. You have to want to do it. If you&#x2019;re not in a good mood and don&#x2019;t feel like cooking, the only thing you should make is a restaurant reservation. And you can&#x2019;t cook with fear. I didn&#x2019;t grow up in the kitchen and I know how it feels to be intimidated by a recipe and be immobilized by that fear. I&#x2019;m here to tell you it&#x2019;s okay to mess up! I&#x2019;ll help you avoid screwing up and tell you what to do in case something does go wrong.<br> <br>Now, it&#x2019;s time to have fun! I&#x2019;m going to make sure you enjoy cooking for family and friends by sharing easy entertaining tricks I&#x2019;ve learned from decades of catering. When you&#x2019;re armed with tips from a pro, cooking with and for friends is the best way to have fun in the kitchen. One of the happiest moments in my life&#x2014;my wedding day&#x2014;came from doing just that. My husband, Matthew, and I celebrated our marriage with forty friends and family and a group of us prepared the food together. I didn&#x2019;t stress over the planning or micromanage the meal. I just let everybody express themselves in the kitchen and it was awesome. I felt like I was on top of the world and I honestly can&#x2019;t imagine a more memorable wedding day. But take my advice as a former caterer: Please don&#x2019;t try this if you have hundreds of guests celebrating with you. LOL.<br> <br>So, are you ready?

His inspirational verse speaks with the universal voice of the human soul and brims with exuberant energy and passion.</p><p>No translator could do greater justice to the gorgeous simplicity of Rumi's poetry than Coleman Barks has done here. These exquisite renderings of the 13th-century Persian mystic's words into American free verse capture all the "inner searching, the delicacy, and simple groundedness" that characterize Rumi's poetry while remaining faithful to the images, tone, and spiritual message of the originals. Barks's introductions to each of the 27 sections (described as "playful palimpsests spread over Rumi's imagination," and "meant to confuse scholars who would divide Rumi's poetry into the accepted categories") are themselves wonderful achievements of a poetic imagination; searching explanations of unfamiliar concepts and funny stories provide colorful background and frame the selections as no dry historical exegesis could. <p> While Barks's stamp on this collection is clear, it in no way interferes with the poems themselves; Rumi's voice leaps off these pages with an ecstatic energy that leaves readers breathless. There are poems of love, rage, sadness, pleading, and longing; passionate outbursts about the torture of longing for his beloved and the sweet pleasure that comes from their union; amusing stories of sexual exploits or human weakness; and quiet truths about the beauty and variety of human emotion. More than anything, Rumi makes plain the unbridled joy that comes from living life fully, urging us always to put aside our fears and take the risk to do so. As he says: "The way of love is not / a subtle argument. / The door there is devastation. / Birds make great sky-circles / of their freedom. / How do they learn it? / They fall, and falling, / they're given wings." <i>--Uma Kukathas</i></p>From the premier interpreter of Rumi comes the first definitive one-volume collection of the enduringly popular spiritual poetry by the extraordinary thirteenth-century Sufi mystic.</p><h2>Look Inside How Things Work</h2><p>Have you ever wondered how cars roar along roads, or planes soar into the sky?

Author Don Spritzer's love of Montana in all its diversity shines through in each vignette as he introduces readers to Montana's independent, adventurous, and often eccentric people. Readers will learn surprising facts about the Treasure State's past and meet its most fascinating people, from the copper kings of Butte to the Freemen of Garfield County.<br>Dividing the state into six geographical-historical areas, <i>Roadside History of Montana</i> follows main highways to reveal the stories hidden within the vast Montana landscape, delighting readers with lively anecdotes along the way. Spritzer speaks of each little town and crossroad with the intimacy of someone who's been there-and indeed he has. Accentuating the text are 170 historical photographs and numerous maps.</p><p>Don Sprtizer, a native of Colorado, has lived in Montana for thirty years. He earned his doctorate in history from the University of Montana. Before retiring, he was a reference librarian at the Missoula Public Library. He has served on Hellgate Elementary School's board for more than twelve years. In addition to several articles on Montana history, he has published tow previous books, <i>Waters of Wealth: The Story of the Kootenai Rivers and Libby Dam</i> and <i>Senator James E. Murray and the Limits of Postwar Liberalism.</i>The narrative is so warm and friendly that the reader forgets it is a printed volume and believes that Spritzer is sitting in the front seat with him, pointing out interesting sites along the road and telling stories. --Dave Walter, Montana Historical Society</p><h2>The Essential Vegan Instant Pot Cookbook: Fresh and Foolproof Plant-Based Recipes for Your Electric Pressure Cooker</h2><p><b><b>This enticing collection of more than 75 easy, inventive, well-tested vegan recipes for the incredibly popular electric pressure cooker, the Instant Pot, is the go-to source for mouthwatering plant-based weekday meals.</b></b><br><br>The best-selling Instant Pot makes cooking delicious meals a snap!

These introductory pages will teach you the basics, and the&nbsp;recipes that follow will provide straightforward, specific instructions to get you pres- sure&nbsp;cooking right away.<br><br>As anyone who has used an Instant Pot can attest, it&#x2019;s an astonishingly convenient, time-saving&nbsp;appliance, light-years ahead of previous generations of stove-top pressure cookers. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;hyperefficient and whisper-quiet when foods are cooking under pressure. There&#x2019;s no need to stand&nbsp;around and tend to an Instant Pot. Once a pressure cooking program begins, you can walk away until&nbsp;a series of beeps tell you the food is ready.<br>Pressure cookers are great for throwing together one-pot soups and stews and for prepping batches&nbsp;of beans and grains for a busy week ahead.

Going as unprocessed as possible is truly the best way I know to lower a&nbsp;grocery bill and eat healthfully. Cooking with in-season produce, dried beans and grains, and&nbsp;bulk-bin pantry staples costs far less in the long run, and the Instant Pot is<br>a great tool to ease and speed up the preparation of healthful foods.<br><br>Whether you&#x2019;re an Instant Pot beginner or just look- ing for a refresher course, read the next few&nbsp;pages to learn about all of the Instant Pot&#x2019;s buttons, bells, and whistles.

This collection also includes one of the all-time classic Peanuts sequences, in which Charlie Brown's baseball-oriented hallucinations finally manifest themselves in a baseball-shaped rash on his head. Forced to conceal the embarrassing discoloration with a bag worn over his head, Charlie Brown goes to camp as "Mister Sack" and discovers that, shorn of his identity, he's suddenly well-liked and successful. Since the volume features a number of tennis strips as well as extended sequences involving Peppermint Patty's friend Marcie (including a riotous, rarely seen sequence in which Marcie's costume-making and hairstyling skills utterly spoil a skating competition for PP), it seems only right that this volume's introduction should be served up by Schulz's longtime friend, tennis champion Billie Jean King.<br><br></p><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s impossible to think of another popular art form that reaches across generations the way the daily comic strip does...at the pinnacle of that long tradition, there was Charles Schulz.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Seattle Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Charles M. Schulz is my favorite cartoonist, so I was excited to see that the twelfth volume in the series has an introduction by the legendary Billie Jean King... This is a important series of books which I give an &#x2018;A Plus&#x2019; and I think it would be the ultimate part of a <em>Peanuts</em> fan&#x2019;s collection!&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Catgirl Critics</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Most comic strips today, especially those that are humor strips, often avoid topical subjects. Schulz embraced the topics of the era. They may date the strip, but it never leaves them outdated. ... Schulz was also not afraid to carry on-going storylines for several days or in some cases, even a couple of weeks. ... [<em>The Complete Peanuts 1973-1974</em>] also features all the favorite subjects like Linus&#x2019; annual wait for the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&#x2019;s trip to Summer camp, and Sally&#x2019;s letters to Santa Claus. This is why Peanuts is the greatest strip ever!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tim Janson, <em>Newsarama</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What more can I say about these wonderful collections? I&#x2019;ve enjoyed each one immensely so far; they make me laugh and grin and even smirk a little from time to time... Top notch book. You can&#x2019;t have a much better time than reading these collections. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Todd Klein, comic book letterer, designer, and writer</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Really strong stuff here, including the "Charlie Brown wears a sack on his head to summer camp" sequence, surely the "Poison River" of <em>Peanuts</em>.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Patrick Markfort,, <em>Articulate Nerd</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fantagraphics Books continues its series devoted to chronologically packaging the strip and has not missed a step along the way. ... I&#x2019;m pleased to inform that the latest edition, the twelfth in the series, is as lovingly curated as the first.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dw.

Does plot come first for you when you begin a book or are you more likely to start from an image or a voice?</strong><br> In this case it started with the first three lines of the second chapter: <i>She will</i> go. For a long time the only thing I knew about the book was that a woman named June was driving away from a small town, heavy with grief and guilt and unable to stay a minute longer. Everything after those words was an unraveling of that mystery&#x2014;<i>Who is she? What is driving her away? What happened? What is the source of her grief? What do the people in the town have to say about her?</i></p> <p><strong>2. You worked on the novel for many years. Do you remember how the first spark of it came to you? </strong><br> The initial impulse came from wanting to write about where I&#x2019;m from. I grew up in a small town two hours from Manhattan and there was a regular gust of moneyed weekend and summer residents that created both a great opportunity to imagine outside of one&#x2019;s life into other possibilities, but it also caused a fair bit of resentment and tension. I wanted to write about the particular experience of such a town, and so the early writing centered on that. </p> <p><strong>3. I'm so impressed by the way you carry off many different yet distinct points of view throughout your novel. It really comes together wonderfully in the end. Did you have any models for this kind of expansive narrative? Did you start out to tell the story in that manner or was it something that evolved over time? </strong><br> Though I didn&#x2019;t consciously follow any model, Jean Stein&#x2019;s <i>Edie</i> no doubt had a strong influence as well as David Huddle&#x2019;s novel <i>The Story of a Million Years</i>. Both books get to the heart of their stories by circling them with other voices and perspectives. </p> <p><strong>4. In many ways, <i>Did You Ever Have a Family</i> seems like an extended meditation on grief and forgiveness. Were your previous memoirs regarding addiction and recovery a springboard into these themes? </strong><br> Surely, they are, though not deliberately. In my recovery I have experienced how powerful and surprising being forgiven can be. I caused a lot of wreckage before I got sober, so if certain people were going to remain in my life I knew that I would need their forgiveness. But what I didn&#x2019;t expect or count on was that in being forgiven, I would learn how to forgive the people I believed had failed or harmed me. The most powerful example of this in my life is with my father. Decades-long resentments and hurt fell away when I could finally see him as a man who did his best and fell short, and him falling short was not the full measure of his character but only a piece in a longer and more complicated story. Letting all that go and allowing myself a relationship with him in his last ten years was a miracle given how estranged we&#x2019;d been, and it is one of the things recovery gave me. In the novel there are a lot of people holding on to anger and guilt and they are lonely, which is something I identify with. Part of what I&#x2019;m exploring in the book is how forgiveness&#x2014;granting as well as receiving&#x2014;can be a beginning to an end of that isolation. </p> <p><strong>5. What book or poem first made you want to be a writer? </strong><br> Reading Natalie Babbitt&#x2019;s <i>Tuck Everlasting</i> was probably the first time where it occurred to me that someone actually came up with an idea and wrote it. And I believe it&#x2019;s the first time I thought, <i>Damn, I wish I&#x2019;d thought of that. </i> </p> <p><strong>6. What novels have you read more than once? </strong><br> I read your novel <i>Dept. of Speculation</i> twice! I read it when it first came out and then, when we decided to talk a few weeks ago, I picked it up again and could not put it down. Crikey, is it good. As nimble and witty as the writing is and as streaking as it is with literary and historical references and anecdotes, it also has this spellbinding effect that only the truth of something can produce. And the truth you are conveying is about marriage and how people happen in them. Reading your novel is a kind of thrill ride but it was also a great relief. But mainly I go back to the same small pile. Besides W. S. Merwin&#x2019;s <i>The Vixen, The Carrier of Ladders</i>, and <i>The Lice</i> (which are poetry collections, not novels), I go back to <i>Jude the Obscure</i> and Lewis Grassic Gibbon&#x2019;s A Scots <i>Quair</i> every now and again. <i>Jude the Obscure</i> because it&#x2019;s such an audacious story and I find something surprising each time, and Gibbon&#x2019;s trilogy because I read it during a time that shaped me&#x2014;an optimistic and curious stretch in my junior year in college&#x2014;and if I feel stuck or limited its peculiar music has the effect of making things seem more possible. I also have reread a lot of Deborah Eisenberg&#x2019;s short stories. <i>Under the 82nd Airborne</i> is one of the best collections of short stories ever. I remember reading it in my twenties in New York and being excited that she lived in Manhattan and was, somewhere in the city, alive and thinking. Before that I mostly read books by long-dead authors so the idea that I could sit next to her on the subway or a restaurant was mind-blowing. I did sit next to her at a play not long ago and I couldn&#x2019;t stop staring. </p> <p><strong>7. Has anything surprised you about the process of publication from the writer's side, and if so, what? </strong><br> I didn&#x2019;t count on finding the conversation about something I&#x2019;d written to be so much, um, fun. With the memoirs, the engagement with readers has been meaningful and, given the main subject matters of addiction and recovery, pretty heavy. But with the novel the exchanges so far have had a giddy pleasure on the level of gossiping about people you went to high school with. It still shocks me that anyone would know and have an opinion about the characters in <i>Did You Ever Have a Family</i>. They existed for so long as just a daydream that to have them named and commented on is startling, but in the best way. Talking about them is a kind of reunion.</p>Bill Clegg is a literary agent in New York and the author of the bestselling memoirs <i>Portrait of an Addict as a Young Man</i> and <i>Ninety Days</i>.

In <em>The Templars</em>, author Michael Haag offers a definitive history of these loyal Christian soldiers of the Crusades&#x2014;sworn to defend the Holy Land and Jerusalem, but ultimately damned and destroyed by the Pope and his church. A bestseller in the United Kingdom&#x2014;the first history of the enigmatic warriors to include findings from the Chinon Parchment, the long-lost Vatican document absolving the Knights of heresy&#x2014;<em>The Templars</em> by Michael Haag<em> </em>is fascinating reading.</p></p><p><blockquote><p>The first history of the legendary knights since the Vatican momentously released the records of their trial and exoneration</p><p>Who were the Templars? <br>What was the secret of their wealth and power? <br>Why did the pope and the king of France act to destroy them?</p></blockquote><p>The Knights Templar were founded on Christmas Day 1119, on the very spot in Jerusalem where Jesus Christ was crucified. A religious order of fighting knights, the Templars defended the Holy Land and Christian pilgrims in the decades after the First Crusade. Legendary for their bravery and dedication, the Templars became one of the wealthiest and most powerful bodies of the medieval world&#x2014;until they were condemned for heresy two centuries after their foundation, when the order was abolished and its leaders were burned at the stake.</p><p>In <em>The Templars</em>, renowned historian Michael Haag investigates the origins and history, the enduring myths, and the soaring architecture of an enigmatic order long shrouded in mystery and controversy. The hand of the Templars, many believe, can be found in everything from Cathar heresy to Masonic conspiracies, and the Knights Templar still inspire popular culture, from Indiana Jones to Xbox games, to the novels of Dan Brown.</p><p>Historian and writer Michael Haag has written widely on the Egyptian, Classical,and Medieval worlds.

Traveling from Portsmouth to the south of France, Tarquin Winot, the book's snobbish narrator, instructs us in his philosophy on everything from the erotics of dislike to the psychology of the menu. Under the guise of completing a cookbook, Winot is in fact on a much more sinister mission that only gradually comes to light.</p><p>A gorgeous, dark, and sensuous book that is part cookbook, part novel, part eccentric philosophical treatise, reminiscent of perhaps the greatest of all books on food, Jean-Anthelme Brillat Savarin&#39;s The Physiology of Taste. Join Tarquin Winot as he embarks on a journey of the senses, regaling us with his wickedly funny, poisonously opinionated meditations on everything from the erotics of dislike to the psychology of a menu, from the perverse history of the peach to the brutalization of the palate, from cheese as &#34;the corpse of milk&#34; to the binding action of blood.This astonishing first novel is narrated by the impeccably correct Tarquin Winot, who relates the story of his life through the most basic and sublime of human passions: food. An Englishman of indeterminate age whose spiritual home has always been France, Tarquin embarks on a journey of the senses as he peels away the layers of his past. Wickedly funny and poisonously opinionated, he proves himself a master of sly wit and subversive ideas. Gradually the outlines of a distinctly quirky aesthetic and a highly eccentric moral universe emerge, and the truth becomes unavoidable. This is not the voluptuary?s memoir it purports to be, and Tarquin Winot is ultimately the master of something infinitely, quiveringly sinister.</p><h2>Deciding What to Teach and Test: Developing, Aligning, and Leading the Curriculum</h2><p><i>"This book makes the reader think deeply about the role of curriculum planning and its connection to assessment in this age of accountability."<br></i>-J.

Then, as an adult depressed by life's ambiguities, the speaker sees gray everywhere until he (or she?) realizes the powerful impact of dreams, which transform the world into a hopeful green. The greeting-card sentimentality isn't for everyone, but the fine, detailed images from Leo and Diane Dillon, Raul Colon, and others may attract aspiring artists. Older teens, especially graduating seniors, may particularly enjoy the comforting, motivational quotes and messages about embracing life's passages and future possibilities. This is published in association with the Legacy Project, which is dedicated to fostering intergenerational communication, and there are free activity kits available online, which, like the book, may help open discussions between adults and young people. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Inside the lunch pail is an official certificate from her working unit. &#x201c;Hereby we confirm Comrade Lin Mei is honorably retired from Beijing Red Star Garment Factory,&#x201d; says the certificate in bright golden characters. It does not say that Red Star Garment Factory has gone bankrupt or that, being honorably retired, Granny Lin will not receive her pension. Of course it will not provide such information, for these facts are simply not true. &#x201c;Bankrupt&#x201d; is the wrong word for a state-owned industry. &#x201c;Internal reorganization&#x201d; is what has been kindly omitted in the certificate. And, mind this, Granny Lin&#x2019;s pension is being withheld only temporarily. For how long, the factory has no further information to offer. &#x201c;There is always a road when you get into the mountain,&#x201d; Auntie Wang, Granny Lin&#x2019;s neighbor, says to her upon being informed of Granny Lin&#x2019;s situation. &#x201c;And there is a Toyota wherever there is a road.&#x201d; The second line of Toyota&#x2019;s commercial slips out before Granny realizes it. &#x201c;There you go, Granny Lin. I know you are an optimistic person. Stay positive and you will find your Toyota.&#x201d; But where on earth can she find a way to replenish her dwindling savings? For a few days Granny Lin adds, subtracts, and divides, and she decides that her savings will run out in a year&#x2014;in two years if she can skip a meal here and there, go to bed right after sunset, and stay bundled up so that she does not have to feed the insatiable stove extra coal balls through the long winter of northern China. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; Auntie Wang says the next time they meet each other at the market, looking down at the single radish Granny Lin has bought for her dinner, as plump as a Buddha, dwelling between her two palms. &#x201c;You can always find someone and get married.&#x201d; &#x201c;Get married?&#x201d; Granny Lin says, and blushes. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so conservative, Granny Lin,&#x201d; Auntie Wang says. &#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d; &#x201c;Fifty-one.&#x201d; &#x201c;You are even younger than I am! I am fifty-eight, but I am not as old-fashioned as you. You know what? Young people no longer have a monopoly on marriage.&#x201d; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me a clown,&#x201d; Granny Lin says. &#x201c;I am serious, Granny Lin. There are so many old widowers in the city. I am sure there are rich and sick ones who need someone to take care of them.&#x201d; &#x201c;You mean, I can find a caretaker&#x2019;s position for old people?&#x201d; Granny Lin asks. Auntie Wang sighs and pokes Granny Lin&#x2019;s forehead with a finger. &#x201c;Use your brain. Not a caretaker but a wife. That way, you can at least inherit some cash when your husband dies.&#x201d; Granny Lin gasps. She has never had a husband in her life, and the prospect of a dead husband frightens her. Yet Auntie Wang makes the decision for her right there and then, between two fish stands, and in a short time she finds Granny Lin a match. &#x201c;Seventy-six. High blood pressure and diabetes. Wife just died. Living alone in a three-bedroom flat. Pension two thousand yuan a month. Both sons married and earning good money in the government,&#x201d; Auntie Wang says, surprised that Granny Lin remains unimpressed. &#x201c;Come on, Granny Lin, where else can you find such a good husband? The old man will die in no time, and the sons are so rich they won&#x2019;t mind sparing some of the old man&#x2019;s savings for you. Let me tell you, this is the most eligible family, as far as I know. Their doorsill has been worn away by the feet of the matchmakers. But of all the possible wives, they are interested only in you. Why? Because you are never married and you have no children. By the way, Granny Lin, how come you aren&#x2019;t married? You never told us the reason.&#x201d; Granny Lin opens and then closes her mouth. &#x201c;It just happens,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to tell me if you don&#x2019;t want to. Anyway, they don&#x2019;t want someone who has a litter of children and grandchildren. I wouldn&#x2019;t trust such a stepmother, either. Who can guarantee that she won&#x2019;t steal from the old man for her children? But you are the best. I have told them that, were there one honest person left on earth, it would be you, Granny Lin. What are you hesitating for?&#x201d; &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t they hire someone to take care of him?&#x201d; Granny Lin asks, thinking of the two sons who might soon become her stepchildren. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t it be cheaper in the long run?&#x201d; &#x201c;Do you not know what those young girls from the nanny market are like? They are lazy, and they steal money&#x2014;husbands, too, if they are hired by young couples. They leave the old people sitting in their own shit all day long. To hire such a girl? Ugh. It would only push him to death quicker.&#x201d; Granny Lin has to agree that, indeed, an older woman as a wife is a wise choice. Accompanied by Auntie Wang, Granny Lin goes to the interview with the two sons and their wives. An hour of questioning later, the two sons exchange a look, and ask if Granny Lin needs some time to consider the marriage offer. Not having much to think about, she moves into her new home in a week. Her husband, Old Tang, is sicker than she has thought. &#x201c;Alzheimer&#x2019;s,&#x201d; a daughter-in-law tells her at their wedding dinner. Granny Lin nods, not knowing what the disease is but guessing that it has something to do with the brain. She supports her husband with both hands and leads him to the table, sitting him down and wiping away the drool from his chin. granny lin becomes a wife, a mother, and a grandmother. She no longer remembers in what year of her life people started to call her Granny Lin instead of Auntie Lin; unmarried women, people believe, age faster. It does not matter anymore, because she feels quite qualified for her name. Every week, one of the sons stops by and checks on Old Tang, leaving enough money for the next week. Old Tang is a quiet man, sitting in his chair by the window, immersed in his bottomless silence. Once in a while, he asks Granny Lin about his wife, and, as instructed by the two sons, Granny Lin replies that the wife is improving in the hospital and will be home in no time. But before she replies Old Tang seems to have forgotten his question, and goes back to his meditation without any sign of having heard Granny Lin. She waits for more questions that never come, and eventually gives up. She turns up the volume of the television and shuffles around the house, sweeping and dusting and wiping and washing, but the time arrives earlier each day when she finishes the housework. Then she sits down on the couch and watches the daytime soap operas. Unlike the twelve-inch television Granny Lin used to own, which required her to make a trip across the room every time she needed to change channels (and all together she got six channels through the antenna made of two steel chopsticks), Old Tang&#x2019;s set is a monster with scores of channels, which all obey a small remote control. Dazed by all the choices she has, and by the ease of moving from one selection to another, Granny Lin soon finds that the machine does her no good. No matter what program she is watching, there is always the nagging worry that she is missing a more interesting one. Several days into her new life, Granny Lin is stunned to discover that she is no longer addicted to television, as she has been in the past ten years. Does marriage have such revolutionary power that a long-established habit can be overthrown in such a short time? Granny Lin sighs and clicks off the television. Old Tang does not notice the silence flooding the room. She realizes then that the television is not to blame. It is because of Old Tang&#x2019;s presence that she cannot focus. She picks up an old magazine and peeks at Old Tang from behind the pages. Ten minutes grows into twenty minutes, and she continues looking at him as he insists on not meeting her gaze. She has an odd suspicion that Old Tang is not ill. He knows she is there, and he is observing her secretly. He knows that his wife of fifty-four years has left him for good and that Granny Lin is his new wife, but he refuses to acknowledge her. He pretends to have lost his mind and expects her to play along as if she were a hired caretaker. But Granny Lin decides not to concede. He is her husband; she is his wife. Their marriage certificate is secure under her pillow. If Old Tang is testing her patience, she is ready to prove it to him; it is a tug-of-war that Granny Lin is determined to win. She puts down the magazine and looks boldly into Old Tang&#x2019;s face, trying to outstare Old Tang. Minutes stretch into an hour, and all of a sudden Granny Lin awakens in a dread that she, too, is losing her mind. She drags her body out of the couch and stretches, feeling the small cracking of her arthritic joints. She looks down at Old Tang, and he is still a statue. Indeed, he is a sick man, she thinks, and feels the shame of having cast rootless doubt on Old Tang, a man as defenseless as a newborn baby. She walks to the kitchen quickly and comes back with a glass of milk. &#x201c;Milk time,&#x201d; she says, patting Old Tang&#x2019;s cheek until he starts to swallow. Three times a day, Granny Lin gives Old Tang an insulin shot. Only then does she catch a glimpse of the life left in Old Tang, the small flinch of the muscle when she pushes the needle into his arm. Sometimes a small bead of blood appears after she draws the needle out, and she wipes it away with her fingertip instead of a cotton ball, entranced by the strange sensation that his blood is seeping into her body. several times a day Granny Lin bathes Old Tang: in the morning and before bedtime, and whenever he wets or dirties himself. The private bathroom is what Granny Lin likes best about her marriage. For all her life, she has used public bathrooms, fighting with other slippery bodies for the lukewarm water drizzling from the rusty showers. Now that she has a bathroom all to herself, she never misses any chance to use it. Old Tang is the only man Granny Lin has seen in full nakedness. The first time she undressed him, she could not help stealing a look now and then at the penis, nestled in a thinning bush. She wondered what it had looked like in its younger years, but right away chased the unclean thought from her mind. The frail nakedness filled her heart with a tenderness she had never experienced, and she has since tended his body with motherly hands. One evening in late February, Granny Lin leads Old Tang to the plastic chair in the middle of the bathroom. She unbuttons his pajamas and he bends his arms at her guidance, his head leaning on her shoulder blade. She removes the nozzle and sprays warm water on his body, putting one hand on his forehead so that the water does not get into his eyes. Granny Lin is squatting on the floor and massaging Old Tang&#x2019;s legs when he touches her shoulder with his palm. She looks up and he is gazing into her eyes. She gives out a cry and backs away from him. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; Old Tang says. &#x201c;Old Tang,&#x201d; Granny Lin says. &#x201c;Is it you?&#x201d; &#x201c;Who are you? Why are you here?&#x201d; &#x201c;I live here,&#x201d; Granny Lin says. She sees an unnatural lucidity in Old Tang&#x2019;s eyes, and feels her heart fall. Such a moment of clarity happens only before a nearing death. Granny Lin had seen the same light two years earlier in her father&#x2019;s eyes, hours before he passed away. She thinks of rushing out to call a doctor, but her feet are locked on the floor, and her eyes are locked in his eyes. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know you. Who are you?&#x201d; Granny Lin looks down at herself. She is wearing a bright yellow plastic poncho and a pair of grass green rubber boots, her outfit for the bath time. &#x201c;I am your wife,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You are not my wife. My wife is Sujane. Where is Sujane?&#x201d; &#x201c;Sujane is no longer with us. I&#x2019;m your new wife.&#x201d; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re lying,&#x201d; Old Tang says, and stands up. &#x201c;Sujane is in the hospital.&#x201d; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Granny Lin says. &#x201c;They lied to you.&#x201d; Old Tang does not hear her. He pushes Granny Lin, and his arms are suddenly strong. Granny Lin clutches him, but he is wild with uncontrollable force. She lets go of his hands, not knowing why she needs to fight with her husband over a dead woman. But he is still wrestling with the air and, two steps away, slips down in a puddle of soapy water. Nobody pays attention to Granny Lin at the funeral. She sits in a corner and listens to the men and women who come up to talk about Old Tang&#x2019;s life: an accomplished physicist and a great teacher, a loving husband, father, and grandfather. The speakers finish and shake the family members&#x2019; hands, ignoring her at the end of the line. I did not kill him, Granny Lin imagines herself telling every person there. He was dying before the fall. But she does not tell the truth to anyone, and instead admits her negligence. Nobody would believe her anyway, for she alone saw the light in his eyes, the last glimmer before the eternal night, as it is called, the brief moment of lucidity before the end. granny lin does not get a penny from Old Tang&#x2019;s savings. She has looked after Old Tang for only two months, and has, in many of the relatives&#x2019; minds, killed him with her carelessness. She does not blame the two sons. She can think only of their loss, a thousand times more painful than her own. When one of them suggests a job in a private boarding school that is run by his friend, Granny Lin almost weeps out of gratitude. Situated in a mountain resort in a western suburb of Beijing, Mei-Mei Academy takes pride in being among the first private schools in the country. It occupies one of the few four-storied buildings that were allowed to be constructed in the area. (&#x201c;Connections, connections,&#x201d; the chef tells Granny Lin the day she arrives&#x2014;how else could the school have gained the permit if not for its powerful trustees?) Private schools, like all private businesses, are sprouting up across the country like bamboo shoots after the first spring rain. Relatives of the Communist Party leaders are being transformed overnight into business owners, their faces appearing on national TV as representatives of the new proletariat entrepreneurs.</p><h2>Henry And Mudge And Annies Good Move</h2><p>In Henry and Mudge&#39;s eighteenth adventure, Henry&#39;s cousin Annie is moving -- right next door to Henry!

He demonstrates the strengths of small congregations, including that today&#39;s church &#34;shoppers&#34; want services that are local, personal, and intimate. Also, small churches provide space to nurture close relationships across age and lifestyle barriers, and they facilitate a higher level of commitment from laypeople. And small church budgets are often more effective because of greater efficiency. The Strategically Small Church will encourage small-church pastors in their ministries and challenge them to play to their strengths.</p><p>Blessed Are the Small <br> <br>Our culture's infatuation with bigness--bigger cars, bigger houses, bigger businesses--has infiltrated the church. But smaller doesn't equal second-rate. Leadership Journal editor and former pastor Brandon O'Brien shows how small churches are uniquely equipped for success in today's culture. <br><br>O'Brien celebrates churches that are taking full advantage of their small size and analyzes how other churches can learn from their strategies. For example, strategically small churches:<br>facilitate a higher level of commitment from laypeople<br>focus attention on fewer programs, increasing effectiveness<br>nurture close relationships across age and life-experience barriers<br><br>But perhaps most important, O'Brien asks churches to rethink what it means to be successful. Sometimes small is just right. <br><br>"Kudos to Brandon O'Brien for reshaping the small-church brand. Using real-life examples of 'small' as an intentional ministry strategy, O'Brien gives hope to small churches everywhere. A must-read for church leaders!" <br><br>Chuck Warnock, Author of <i>Confessions of a Small-Church Pastor</i><br><br>"Every page paints a picture of the strategic potential for kingdom ministry that flows from smaller churches."<br><br>Kara E.

He was destined to be one of those rare "high-character " superstars. But in 2001, working his way from the minors to the majors, all of the plans for Josh went off the rails in a moment of weakness. What followed was a 4-year nightmare of drugs and alcohol, estrangement from friends and family, and his eventual suspension from baseball. <br><br>BEYOND BELIEF details the events that led up to the derailment. Josh explains how a young man destined for fame and wealth could allow his life to be taken over by drugs and alcohol. But it is also the memoir of a spiritual journey that breaks through pain and heartbreak and leads to the spectacular rebirth of his major-league career.<br><br>Josh Hamilton makes no excuses and places no blame on anyone other than himself. He takes responsibility for his poor decisions and believes his story can help millions who battle the same demons. "I have been given a platform to tell my story" he says. "I pray every night I am a good messenger." Also, as part of the paperback edition of BEYOND BELIEF, Josh's journey has been updated to include developments in his recovery.</p><p>Josh Hamilton is an outfielder with the Los Angeles Angels and perennial Major League Baseball All-Star.

The cotton yarn, handspun on an Indian book charkha, gives the pictures such a three-dimensional look that one feels as though it could be plucked right off Gandhi&#x2019;s spinning wheel.

Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, writing of this small group of Mormon women who've previously been seen as mere names and dates, has brilliantly reconstructed these textured, complex lives to give us a fulsome portrait of who these women were and of their "sex radicalism"--the idea that a woman should choose when and with whom to bear children.</p><p><b>LAUREL THATCHER ULRICH</b> was born in Sugar City, Idaho.

When he left Kirtland two years before, the temple had been only a dream. Now it rose before him, more magnificent, he thought, &#x201c;than Kings ever saw or Princes ever Knew.&#x201d; His excitement grew as he entered the village. In 1834, the little band of Latter-day Saints in Ohio had been poor and despised by their neighbors. Now there were signs of progress everywhere. He and his companion, a Kentuckian named Abraham Smoot, lost no time in touring the temple, from the light-filled assembly rooms on the lower levels to the offices in the attic, where Joseph Smith kept the Egyptian mummies and fragments of papyri that he said contained the writings of the Biblical Abraham. &#x201c;Wonder on wonder strikes my sense to look into the Casket of the great work of Israels God in these last Days,&#x201d; Wilford wrote.<br><br>For a newly settled town in Ohio&#x2019;s Western Reserve, the building was indeed impressive. Sited on the highest point of land in the region, it had a soaring sanctuary on each of its main floors and a polychrome tower reaching to the sky. Some said that on a clear day visitors to the tower could see across Lake Erie to Canada. Color added to the building&#x2019;s glory. The roof was a deep brick red, the exterior walls a glistening gray-blue created by grinding broken glass and cobalt-glazed ceramics into the stucco, then painting lines to simulate stonework. Two olive-green doors opened into the interior. A model of Yankee ingenuity and rural pretension, the temple had Greek pilasters and Gothic windows, ascending pulpits on both ends of the major rooms, movable seats in the pews, and adjustable curtains operated by pulleys to subdivide the spaces. Red velvet drapery ornamented the pulpits.<br><br>Latter-day Saints believed God, speaking through Joseph Smith, had commanded them to build the temple. Smith&#x2019;s revelation called it a &#x201c;house&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.&#x201d; At its dedication in March 1836, some heard the sound of a mighty wind as a pillar of light descended. Others saw angels soaring through the windows to settle on the high pulpits. It was a house of glory built by common folk. Bolstered by contributions gathered by missionaries like Wilford, its construction provided work for common laborers as well as for skilled carpenters like Brigham Young. God may have prescribed the dimensions of the building, but human beings quarried the stone, planed the planks, stitched the draperies, and constructed the window mullions and sashes, using carpenters&#x2019; manuals and Smith&#x2019;s visions for their guide.<br><br>On his first Sunday back in the town, Wilford stood in one of the pulpits and reported on his mission. He took as his text a passage in Isaiah about God&#x2019;s power to graft into the House of Israel even &#x201c;the son of the stranger.&#x201d; Wilford was talking about the men and women he had baptized in Kentucky and Tennessee. He was also talking about himself. The scripture promised, &#x201c;Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.&#x201d;<br><br>Like many New Englanders of his generation, Wilford had migrated west in search of new opportunities. Now, nearly thirty, he had neither a wife nor a home of his own, but in Kirtland he had a place of honor in God&#x2019;s house. Soon, though he did not yet know it, he would find a wife&#x2014;a resolute New Englander named Phebe Carter. Together they would begin a journey that would take them to their old homes in Connecticut and Maine and then to the Fox Islands, off the Atlantic coast, to gather others&#x2014;relatives and strangers&#x2014;into a faith that promised wonders on wonders.<br><br>&#x201c;The First Book of Willford&#x201d;<br><br>Born in Connecticut in 1807, Wilford was the youngest of Aphek and Beulah Woodruff&#x2019;s three children, all boys. When he was just a year old, his mother died in the midst of a spotted-fever epidemic that also claimed his grandfather. When Wilford was not yet three, his father married Azubah Hart, who gave birth to six more children, five boys and a girl. Azubah&#x2019;s boys were haunted by death. Julius died shortly after birth, Franklin at three months; Newton drowned at two. Sixteen-year-old Philo fell ill after dreaming that there would soon be a funeral in the family. His death provoked Wilford, who was then twenty, to consider his own spiritual state. He asked a local Baptist preacher to baptize him by immersion, but he did not join any church.<br><br>After a short stint at the Farmington Academy (his family could not afford more), he moved with his older brother Azmon to a farm in upstate New York. When Mormon missionaries came through in 1833, both accepted baptism. In 1834, Wilford, the more zealous convert, headed to Ohio to meet Joseph Smith. There he joined &#x201c;Zion&#x2019;s Camp,&#x201d; a quasi-military expedition sent to relieve Mormon settlers in Jackson County, Missouri, who had been driven from their homes. From there, he accepted a call to serve as a missionary in Tennesee and Kentucky. During his two years in the backcountry, he supported himself by selling subscriptions to the Latter Day Saints&#x2019; Messenger and Advocate, performing day labor, and accepting food, lodging, and cash donations from church members and strangers.<br><br>One of Joseph Smith&#x2019;s revelations assured newly called missionaries that &#x201c;whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture.&#x201d; Wilford took those words seriously. He learned to preach, and he learned to keep a diary, labeling his four-by-six leather-bound journal &#x201c;The First Book of Willford.&#x201d; At first, he wrote in a loose, almost unformed scrawl, taking rough notes that he later transcribed, first in cursive, then in a kind of Roman print that appeared to imitate type. To make it easier to find things, he began setting off certain entries with special symbols or borders, using the calligraphy skills he had acquired during his short time at school. Thanks to his end-of-year summaries, we know that during his two-year mission he traveled 6,557 miles, held 153 meetings, participated in four debates, baptized twenty-seven persons, blessed nineteen children, healed four persons, and escaped from three mobs. The mobs were an affirmation of his calling. Hadn&#x2019;t the ancient apostles also suffered opposition?<br><br>At a place he called &#x201c;Bloody [Creek?], Kentucky,&#x201d; he gave a full page to a dream or vision of the sun going dark and the moon turned to blood and &#x201c;the horizon covered with burning cities,&#x201d; as prophesied in scripture. He then saw the resurrection of Jesus and witnessed the joy of members of the Church of the First Born clothed in white. Words were not enough to describe such an experience. He ornamented his page with tiny sketches of the things he had seen.<br><br>When he returned to Kirtland late in 1836, he expected even more powerful manifestations of God&#x2019;s presence. He enrolled in something called the &#x201c;School of the Prophets,&#x201d; an adult-education program for Mormon preachers, where he learned a smattering of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. Between January and May 1837, he attended evening meetings of the Quorum of Seventies, a group of men with special callings to preach. He participated in private &#x201c;feasts,&#x201d; during which food was distributed to the poor, and in &#x201c;blessing meetings,&#x201d; where Joseph Smith&#x2019;s father, who had been called as church patriarch, laid his hands on the heads of members to offer consolation, affirmation of lineage in the House of Israel, and the promise of future redemption. When Father Smith blessed Abraham Smoot, Wilford served as scribe, taking down the blessing in his neat Roman hand.<br><br>For Wilford, the most important gatherings occurred within the temple. Here he could listen to Joseph Smith and the Apostles speak and participate in holy rituals. The Prophet had already adopted the Christian practice of washing feet, but in 1836 he reached backward to the book of Exodus, building on a passage that described Moses bringing Aaron and his sons &#x201c;to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation&#x201d; for a special washing and anointing that allowed them to minister as priests. On April 4, 1837, Wilford and twenty-two other men gathered at a private home and washed themselves &#x201c;with clean watter &amp; perfumes&#x201d; before repairing to the temple for an anointing. Although the Old Testament recipe called for myrrh, sweet cinnamon, calamus, and cassia, the Saints made do with cinnamon.<br><br>After the anointing, Wilford joined two other men in a veiled space in the temple. They knelt in prayer and, in Wilford&#x2019;s words, vowed &#x201c;that we would not give sleep to our eyes neither take food until we receieved a blessing from God by the outpourings of his spirit upon us if it was until the end of three days.&#x201d; Alternately praying and contending with a fatigue they associated with Satan, they continued through the night. Then, having &#x201c;gained a good degree of victory over the Devil,&#x201d; they left the temple, to return that evening for another round. In contrast to the elaborate vision he had recorded in Kentucky, Wilford measured the success of this experience not by a visual manifestation, but by the peace he felt: &#x201c;The spirit of God sat upon us &amp; we were satisfied with our blessing.&#x201d;<br><br>Years later, a church leader who had been in Kirtland said that, when Joseph Smith introduced the ritual of washing and anointing to male leaders, some women got &#x201c;right huffy about it,&#x201d; feeling that they had been left out. If so, they neglected to record their complaints. Their memoirs recall spiritual manifestations, such as an outpouring of glossolalia or &#x201c;speaking in tongues.&#x201d; Some heard an invisible choir during services in the temple. One young mother claimed that her six-month-old baby slept quietly through the seven-hour dedication ceremony, then joined the crowd in shouting &#x201c;Hosanna!&#x201d;<br><br>The completion of the temple nevertheless marked a subtle transition in Latter-day Saint worship, which had previously focused on small gatherings in homes. In Kirtland, Elizabeth Ann and Newel Whitney often hosted &#x201c;Feasts for the Poor,&#x201d; like the ones Wilford attended, occasions when guests fasted for two meals, then brought butter, bread, or other foods to share with the needy. When held in the temple, fast days like these took on a more formal quality. On March 23, 1837, Wilford arrived early and retired to a veiled area with several other elders for prayer. As the crowd gathered, he emerged into the main space, where, at the invitation of the Prophet&#x2019;s father, he read a passage from the Book of Mormon while the congregation stood. Then the curtains dropped, dividing the room into four parts&#x2014;&#x201c;the females occupied two parts &amp; the males the others.&#x201d; Male leaders presided in each of the divisions as people engaged &#x201c;in singing, exhortation, &amp; prayer. Some had a tongue, others an interpretation, &amp; all was in order.&#x201d;<br><br>The reference to &#x201c;order&#x201d; is significant. Joseph Smith had been shocked when he first arrived in Kirtland by the extremes of &#x201c;enthusiasm&#x201d; that greeted him. The temple became a setting for encouraging and at the same time containing ecstatic expression. With the room divided, four times as many people had an opportunity to participate, but the presence of a member of the presidency in each group prevented things from getting out of hand. Wilford explained that, after the separate meetings, &#x201c;the Veils were all rolled up together which brought the whole Congregation in full view of each other and while the presence of the Lord filled the house the congregation of the Saints fell upon their knees &amp; all as one man vocally poured forth rejoicing, supplication &amp; Prayer, before the God of Israel.&#x201d; Presumably, the phrase &#x201c;one man&#x201d; included women, though we cannot be sure.<br><br>Movable seats in the pews allowed people to face pulpits on either the east or the west side, as required. The pulpits themselves ascended in four levels, with three stations in each. Those on the west held the presidencies of the Melchizedek or the &#x201c;higher&#x201d; priesthood; those on the east, the Aaronic, or &#x201c;lesser.&#x201d; With eight presidencies and twenty-four men involved, authority was both widely distributed and heirarchically ordered. Joseph Smith and his two counselors commanded the top tier in the Melchizedek pulpit.<br><br>While Wilford filled his diary with details about temple worship, something else was happening unnoticed. In early April, he set off a blank space with a distinct border and reported dryly, &#x201c;My first acquaintance with miss Phebe W. Carter was on the evening of the 28th of Jan. 1837 at which time I was introduc&#x2019;d to her at Elder Milliken&#x2019;s by the politeness of Elder M. Holmes. After two &amp; half months acquaintance we were joined in matrimony.&#x201d; In the midst of religious ecstasy, he had found a wife.<br><br>&#x201c;to leave my paternal roof&#x201d;<br><br>Phebe Carter was born in Scarborough, Maine, a coastal town just south of Portland, on March 8, 1807. She was just seven days younger than Wilford and, at the age of thirty, a true peer, having embraced the Latter-day Saint gospel wholeheartedly and on her own. Unlike him, she had grown up in a house full of females. When Mormon missionaries came through Scarborough in 1834, Phebe&#x2019;s younger sisters Rhoda, Shuah, and Mary, all in their twenties, were still at home, and the one married sister, Sarah Foss, lived nearby. In the minority were the three brothers, Ezra, Fabyan, and Ilus. Like many young women of her generation, Phebe worked off and on as a teacher and a dressmaker. In a period when an increasing number of women remained single, she must have wondered whether it would be her lot to live and die in the big house where she had been born.<br><br>Almost as soon as she was baptized, she contemplated moving to Kirtland. In Mormonism, the concept of &#x201c;gathering&#x201d; was central. Believing that the second coming of Jesus was imminent, missionaries taught that newly baptized members had a duty to migrate to the Mormon Zion to become &#x201c;the first laborers in this last kingdom.&#x201d; Although hundreds of New England women left home to work in nearby textile mills or teach in a rural school, very few set off alone to join a religious community seven hundred miles away. Phebe&#x2019;s family opposed her plan, and when it came time to leave, she was too overcome with emotion to say goodbye in person. Instead, she composed a letter for them to read once she was out of sight.<br><br>That the letter survived suggests that her family cherished it. Written in a neat and legible hand on two long sheets of cream-colored paper, it displayed a better-than-average education, a mastery of religious rhetoric, and significantly less sentimentality than Wilford&#x2019;s writing. &#x201c;Beloved Parents,&#x201d; she began, &#x201c;I am now about to leave my parent paternal roof for a while but I know not how long&#x2014;but not without grateful feelings for the kindness which I have receivd from my infancy until the present time.&#x201d; There are no protestations of love in this opening, just a straightforward statement of the situation. She appreciated all her parents had done for her, but wanted them to know that it was time for them to part. Providence had willed it thus. That she changed &#x201c;parental&#x201d; to &#x201c;paternal roof&#x201d; surely reflects an inbred sense that houses belonged to fathers. It may also hint at her meticulousness and her bookishness. Although the phrase &#x201c;paternal roof&#x201d; was common in both fiction and poetry between 1800 and 1840, the term &#x201c;parental roof&#x201d; was seldom used before the twentieth century. To Phebe it probably didn&#x2019;t have quite the right ring.</p><h2>The Principle of the Integral Good</h2><p>This text explores the nature of the Principle of the Integral good and its application to art, music, movies, ecclesiology and evolution.</p><p></p><h2>Sunday Morning Hymn Duet Companion: 17 Familiar Hymns for One Piano, Four Hands (Sacred Performer Duet Collections)</h2><p>Victor Labenske has created 17 professional-sounding yet technically accessible duet arrangements of the most commonly used hymns.

In a sad irony, Hannah Freeman was establishing her residency&#x2014;a claim that paved the way for her removal to the poorhouse. Ultimately, however, it meant final removal from the ancestral land she had so tenaciously maintained. Thus was William Penn&#x2019;s &#x201c;peaceable kingdom&#x201d; preserved.&nbsp;<br><br><i>A Lenape among the Quakers</i> reconstructs Freeman&#x2019;s history, from the days of her grandmothers before European settlement to the beginning of the nineteenth century. The story that emerges is one of persistence and resilience, as &#x201c;Indian Hannah&#x201d; negotiates life with the Quaker neighbors who employ her, entrust their children to her, seek out her healing skills, and, when she is weakened by sickness and age, care for her. Yet these are the same neighbors whose families then dispossess her own. Fascinating in its own right,&nbsp;Freeman&#x2019;s life is also remarkable as a unique account of a Native American woman in a colonial community during a time of dramatic transformation and upheaval. In particular, it expands our understanding of colonial history and the Native experience that history often renders silent.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Dawn G.

The second she walked into the kitchen she felt the hostility, like the bone-deep cold of the wind that blew through the streets of Berlin before a February snowstorm. She almost turned and walked back out again.<br><br>It was unusual for them to fight. Mostly they were affectionate&#x2014;too much so. Carla cringed when they kissed in front of other people. Her friends thought it was strange: their parents did not do that. She had said that to her mother, once. Mother had laughed in a pleased way and said: &#x201c;The day after our wedding, your father and I were separated by the Great War.&#x201d; She had been born English, though you could hardly tell. &#x201c;I stayed in London while he came home to Germany and joined the army.&#x201d; Carla had heard this story many times, but Mother never tired of telling it. &#x201c;We thought the war would last three months, but I didn&#x2019;t see him again for five years. All that time I longed to touch him. Now I never tire of it.&#x201d;<br><br>Father was just as bad. &#x201c;Your mother is the cleverest woman I ever met,&#x201d; he had said here in the kitchen just a few days ago. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I married her. It had nothing to do with . . .&#x201d; He had trailed off, and Mother and he had giggled conspiratorially, as if Carla at the age of eleven knew nothing about sex. It was so embarrassing.<br><br>But once in a while they had a quarrel. Carla knew the signs. And a new one was about to erupt.<br><br>They were sitting at opposite ends of the kitchen table. Father was somberly dressed in a dark gray suit, starched white shirt, and black satin tie. He looked dapper, as always, even though his hair was receding and his waistcoat bulged a little beneath the gold watch chain. His face was frozen in an expression of false calm. Carla knew that look. He wore it when one of the family had done something that angered him.<br><br>He held in his hand a copy of the weekly magazine for which Mother worked, The Democrat. She wrote a column of political and diplomatic gossip under the name of Lady Maud. Father began to read aloud. &#x201c;&#x2018; &#x2018;Our new chancellor, Herr Adolf Hitler, made his debut in diplomatic society at President Hindenburg&#x2019;s reception.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>The president was the head of state, Carla knew. He was elected, but he stood above the squabbles of day-to-day politics, acting as referee. The chancellor was the premier. Although Hitler had been made chancellor, his Nazi Party did not have an overall majority in the Reichstag&#x2014;the German parliament&#x2014;so, for the present, the other parties could restrain Nazi excesses.<br><br>Father spoke with distaste, as if forced to mention something repellent, like sewage. &#x201c; &#x2018;He looked uncomfortable in a formal tailcoat.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Carla&#x2019;s mother sipped her coffee and looked out of the window to the street, as if interested in the people hurrying to work in scarves and gloves. She, too, was pretending to be calm, but Carla knew she was just waiting for her moment.<br><br>The maid, Ada, was standing at the counter in an apron, slicing cheese. She put a plate in front of Father, but he ignored it. &#x201c; &#x2018;Herr Hitler was evidently charmed by Elisabeth Cerruti, the cultured wife of the Italian ambassador, in a rose-pink velvet gown trimmed with sable.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Mother always wrote about what people were wearing. She said it helped the reader picture them. She herself had fine clothes, but times were hard and she had not bought anything new for years. This morning she looked slim and elegant in a navy blue cashmere dress that was probably as old as Carla.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Signora Cerruti, who is Jewish, is a passionate Fascist, and they talked for many minutes. Did she beg Hitler to stop whipping up hatred of Jews?&#x2019;&#x201d; Father put the magazine down on the table with a slap.<br><br>Here it comes, Carla thought.<br><br>&#x201c;You realize that will infuriate the Nazis,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope so,&#x201d; Mother said coolly. &#x201c;The day they&#x2019;re pleased with what I write, I shall give it up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re dangerous when riled.&#x201d;<br><br>Mother&#x2019;s eyes flashed anger. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare condescend to me, Walter. I know they&#x2019;re dangerous&#x2014;that&#x2019;s why I oppose them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t see the point of making them irate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You attack them in the Reichstag.&#x201d; Father was an elected parliamentary representative for the Social Democratic Party.<br><br>&#x201c;I take part in a reasoned debate.&#x201d;<br><br>This is typical, Carla thought. Father was logical, cautious, law-abiding. Mother had style and humor. He got his way by quiet persistence, she with charm and cheek. They would never agree.<br><br>Father added: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t drive the Nazis mad with fury.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps that&#x2019;s because you don&#x2019;t do them much harm.&#x201d;<br><br>Father was irritated by her quick wit. His voice became louder. &#x201c;And you think you damage them with jokes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mock them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s your substitute for argument.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I believe we need both.&#x201d;<br><br>Father became angrier. &#x201c;But, Maud, don&#x2019;t you see how you&#x2019;re putting yourself and your family at risk?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On the contrary. The real danger is not to mock the Nazis. What would life be like for our children if Germany became a Fascist state?&#x201d;<br><br>This kind of talk made Carla feel queasy. She could not bear to hear that the family was in danger. Life must go on as it always had. She wished she could sit in this kitchen for an eternity of mornings, with her parents at opposite ends of the pine table, Ada at the counter, and her brother, Erik, thumping around upstairs, late again. Why should anything change?<br><br>She had listened to political talk every breakfast-time of her life and she thought she understood what her parents did, and how they planned to make Germany a better place for everyone. But lately they had begun to talk in a different way. They seemed to think that a terrible danger loomed, but Carla could not quite imagine what it was.<br><br>Father said: &#x201c;God knows I&#x2019;m doing everything I can to hold back Hitler and his mob.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And so am I. But, when you do it, you believe you&#x2019;re following a sensible course.&#x201d; Mother&#x2019;s face hardened in resentment. &#x201c;And when I do it I&#x2019;m accused of putting the family at risk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And with good reason,&#x201d; said Father. The row was only just getting started, but at that moment Erik came down, clattering like a horse on the stairs, and lurched into the kitchen with his school satchel swinging from his shoulder. He was thirteen, two years older than Carla, and there were unsightly black hairs sprouting from his upper lip. When they were small, Carla and Erik had played together all the time; but those days were over, and since he had grown so tall he had pretended to think she was stupid and childish. In fact she was smarter than he, and knew about a lot of things he did not understand, such as women&#x2019;s monthly cycles.<br><br>&#x201c;What was that last tune you were playing?&#x201d; he said to Mother.<br><br>The piano often woke them in the morning. It was a Steinway grand&#x2014;inherited, like the house itself, from Father&#x2019;s parents. Mother played in the morning because, she said, she was too busy the rest of the day and too tired in the evening. This morning she had performed a Mozart sonata, then a jazz tune. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called &#x2018;Tiger Rag,&#x2019;&#x201d; she told Erik. &#x201c;Do you want some cheese?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jazz is decadent,&#x201d; Erik said.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly.&#x201d;<br><br>Ada handed Erik a plate of cheese and sliced sausage, and he began to shovel it in. Carla thought his manners were dreadful.<br><br>Father looked severe. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s been teaching you this nonsense, Erik?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hermann Braun says that jazz isn&#x2019;t music, just Negroes making a noise.&#x201d; Hermann was Erik&#x2019;s best friend; his father was a member of the Nazi Party.<br><br>&#x201c;Hermann should try to play it.&#x201d; Father looked at Mother, and his face softened. She smiled at him. He went on: &#x201c;Your mother tried to teach me ragtime, many years ago, but I couldn&#x2019;t master the rhythm.&#x201d;<br><br>Mother laughed. &#x201c;It was like trying to get a giraffe to roller-skate.&#x201d;<br><br>The fight was over, Carla saw with relief. She began to feel better. She took some black bread and dipped it in milk.<br><br>But now Erik wanted an argument. &#x201c;Negroes are an inferior race,&#x201d; he said defiantly.<br><br>&#x201c;I doubt that,&#x201d; Father said patiently. &#x201c;If a Negro boy were brought up in a nice house full of books and paintings, and sent to an expensive school with good teachers, he might turn out to be smarter than you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s ridiculous!&#x201d; Erik protested.<br><br>Mother put in: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call your father ridiculous, you foolish boy.&#x201d; Her tone was mild: she had used up her anger on Father. Now she just sounded wearily disappointed. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about, and neither does Hermann Braun.&#x201d;<br><br>Erik said: &#x201c;But the Aryan race must be superior&#x2014;we rule the world!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your Nazi friends don&#x2019;t know any history,&#x201d; Father said. &#x201c;The Ancient Egyptians built the pyramids when Germans were living in caves. Arabs ruled the world in the Middle Ages&#x2014;the Muslims were doing algebra when German princes could not write their own names. It&#x2019;s nothing to do with race.&#x201d;<br><br>Carla frowned and said: &#x201c;What is it to do with, then?&#x201d;<br><br>Father looked at her fondly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a very good question, and you&#x2019;re a bright girl to ask it.&#x201d; She glowed with pleasure at his praise. &#x201c;Civilizations rise and fall&#x2014;the Chinese, the Aztecs, the Romans&#x2014;but no one really knows why.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eat up, everyone, and put your coats on,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s getting late.&#x201d;<br><br>Father pulled his watch out of his waistcoat pocket and looked at it with raised eyebrows. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to take Carla to the Francks&#x2019; house,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;The girls&#x2019; school is closed for a day&#x2014;something about repairing the furnace&#x2014;so Carla&#x2019;s going to spend today with Frieda.&#x201d;<br><br>Frieda Franck was Carla&#x2019;s best friend. Their mothers were best friends, too. In fact, when they were young, Frieda&#x2019;s mother, Monika, had been in love with Father&#x2014;a hilarious fact that Frieda&#x2019;s grandmother had revealed one day after drinking too much Sekt.<br><br>Father said: &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t Ada look after Carla?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ada has an appointment with the doctor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d;<br><br>Carla expected Father to ask what was wrong with Ada, but he nodded as if he already knew, and put his watch away. Carla wanted to ask, but something told her she should not. She made a mental note to ask Mother later. Then she immediately forgot about it.<br><br>Father left first, wearing a long black overcoat. Then Erik put on his cap&#x2014;perching it as far back on his head as it would go without falling off, as was the fashion among his friends&#x2014;and followed Father out of the door.<br><br>Carla and her mother helped Ada clear the table. Carla loved Ada almost as much as she loved her mother. When Carla was little, Ada had taken care of her full-time, until she was old enough to go to school, for Mother had always worked. Ada was not married yet. She was twenty-nine and homely-looking, though she had a lovely kind smile. Last summer she had had a romance with a policeman, Paul Huber, but it had not lasted.<br><br>Carla and her mother stood in front of the mirror in the hall and put on their hats. Mother took her time. She chose a dark blue felt, with a round crown and a narrow brim, the type all the women were wearing, but she tilted hers at a different angle, making it look chic. As Carla put on her knitted wool cap, she wondered whether she would ever have Mother&#x2019;s sense of style. Mother looked like a goddess of war, her long neck and chin and cheekbones carved out of white marble; beautiful, yes, but definitely not pretty. Carla had the same dark hair and green eyes, but looked more like a plump doll than a statue. Carla had once accidentally overheard her grandmother say to Mother: &#x201c;Your ugly duckling will grow into a swan, you&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d; Carla was still waiting for it to happen.<br><br>When Mother was ready, they went out. Their home stood in a row of tall, gracious town houses in the Mitte district, the old center of the city, built for high-ranking ministers and army officers such as Carla&#x2019;s grandfather, who had worked at the nearby government buildings.<br><br>Carla and her mother rode a tram along Unter den Linden, then took the S train from Friedrich Strasse to the Zoo Station. The Francks lived in the southwestern suburb of Sch�neberg.<br><br>Carla was hoping to see Frieda&#x2019;s brother Werner, who was fourteen. She liked him. Sometimes Carla and Frieda imagined they each married the other&#x2019;s brother, and were next-door neighbors, and their children were best friends. It was just a game to Frieda, but Carla was secretly serious. Werner was handsome and grown-up and not a bit silly like Erik. In the dollhouse in Carla&#x2019;s bedroom, the mother and father sleeping side by side in the miniature double bed were called Carla and Werner, but no one knew that, not even Frieda.<br><br>Frieda had another brother, Axel, seven, but he had been born with spina bifida, and had to have constant medical care. He lived in a special hospital on the outskirts of Berlin.<br><br>Mother was preoccupied on the journey. &#x201c;I hope this is going to be all right,&#x201d; she muttered, half to herself, as they got off the train.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course it will,&#x201d; Carla said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a lovely time with Frieda.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean that. I&#x2019;m talking about my paragraph about Hitler.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are we in danger? Was Father right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your father is usually right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What will happen to us if we&#x2019;ve annoyed the Nazis?&#x201d;<br><br>Mother stared at her strangely for a long moment, then said: &#x201c;Dear God, what kind of a world did I bring you into?&#x201d; Then she went quiet.<br><br>After a ten-minute walk they arrived at a grand villa in a big garden. The Francks were rich: Frieda&#x2019;s father, Ludwig, owned a factory making radio sets. Two cars stood in the driveway. The large shiny black one belonged to Herr Franck. The engine rumbled, and a cloud of blue vapor rose from the tailpipe. The chauffeur, Ritter, with uniform trousers tucked into high boots, stood cap in hand ready to open the door.

Fee's method is exemplary: he first analyzes Paul's statements about the Spirit, in each individual letter, and then moves to a synthesis of Paul's general pneumatology. The result is a book that is deeply exegetical, doing justice both to the particularity of Paul's writings and to the fundamental unity of his vision for the Spirit's role in the life of the Christian community. Most importantly, Fee emphasizes insistently that the Holy Spirit must be experienced as a living presence within the church. That message is both faithful to Paul and urgent for the community of faith in our time."--Richard B. Hays, professor of New Testament, Duke University Divinity School<br><br>"With the energy and care that is a trademark of his work, Gordon Fee here fills a significant gap in Pauline studies. Both those who find talk about the Holy Spirit congenial and those who would happily marginalize it will be instructed by this book. Fee makes a genuine contribution as he examines Paul's letters in conversation with both the exegetical tradition of the academy and the pressing needs of the church."--Beverly R. Gaventa, professor of New Testament and exegesis, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"Fee uniquely combines professional competence as a text critic, an exegete, an author and editor of major commentaries, and a foremost evangelical interpreter of Paul with a lifetime of formation and ministry among the Pentecostals--this century's providential witnesses to the work of the Spirit of God among us. . . . Fee's work offers an enduring encyclopedia of Pauline pneumatological exegesis, easy to consult for next Sunday's sermon, yet substantial enough to take its place near George Ladd's <i>Theology of the New Testament </i>as a must-have, within arm's reach, for serious interpreters of Paul's gospel. . . . Fee's work is the theological crown of a distinguished exegetical career."--Russell P. Spittler, senior professor of New Testament, Fuller Theological Seminary</p><p><b>Gordon D. Fee</b> (PhD, University of Southern California) is professor emeritus of New Testament studies at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Spittler, Director of the David du Plessis Center for Christian Spirituality, Professor of New Testament, Fuller Theological Seminary&#34;Our appreciation of the Holy Spirit in Paul&#34; both in academic and larger church circles&#34; has long needed thorough exegetical and theological analysis. By focusing on careful examination of every Pauline text related to the Spirit, Gordon Fee has helpfully filled this lacuna.&#34;&#34; Joel B. Green, Associate Professor of NT, American Baptist Seminary of the West, Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley&#34;Students of Paul&#39;s letters and theology have long been in need of a major scholarly investigation of his treatment of the Spirit. By providing such an investigation with the same high standards of scholarship and skills of communication exhibited in his outstanding commentary on 1 Corinthians, and by doing so with an eye on the present renewed interest in the work of the Spirit in the church, Gordon Fee has put us doubly in his debt. His effective combinationof thorough and robust exegesis with invigorating theological reflection that views Paul&#39;s experience of and concern with the Spirit from an eschatological and Trinitarian perspective drives home what we should have known&#34; that the Spirit is far more central to Paul&#39;s thought than most of his interpreters have recognized. Fee&#39;s comprehensive and challenging new study will be appreciated not only by professional interpreters of Paul but by all who have a serious interest in the biblical resources for spiritual renewal.&#34;&#34; Andrew T.

J. Rose</strong></p><p>The first practical and accessible guide to the art of punctuation for creative writers. Punctuation reveals the writer: haphazard commas, for example, reveal haphazard thinking; clear, lucid breaks reveal clear, lucid thinking. Punctuation can be used to teach the writer how to think and how to write. This short, practical book shows authors the benefits that can be reaped from mastering punctuation: the art of style, sentence length, meaning, and economy of words. There are full-length chapters devoted to the period, the comma, the semicolon, the colon, quotation marks, the dash and parentheses, the paragraph and section break, and a cumulative chapter on integrating them all into "The Symphony of Punctuation." Filled with exercises and examples from literary masters (Why did Poe and Melville rely on the semicolon? Why did Hemingway embrace the period?), <em>A Dash of Style</em> is interactive, highly engaging, and a necessity for creative writers as well as for anyone looking to make punctuation their friend instead of their mysterious foe.</p></p><p>Noah Lukeman is the author of several bestselling books on the craft of writing, among them A Dash of Style: The Art and Mastery of Punctuation.

In this revised and updated edition, Keyssar carries the story forward, from the disputed presidential contest of 2000 through the 2008 campaign and the election of Barack Obama. <i>The Right to Vote</i> is a sweeping reinterpretation of American political history as well as a meditation on the meaning of democracy in contemporary American life.<i><br></i></p><p><b>Alexander Keyssar</b> is the Matthew W. Stirling, Jr., Professor of History and Social Policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. His 1986 book, <i>Out of Work</i>, was awarded three scholarly prizes, and his book, <i>The Right to Vote</i>, was named the best book in U.S. history by both the American Historical Association and the Historical Society; it was also a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the Los Angeles Times Book Award. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.HAmerica's self-image as the land of democracy flows from the belief that we've long enjoyed universal suffrageDor at least aspired to it. Duke historian Keyssar (Out of Work: The First Century of Unemployment in Massachusetts) convincingly shows that, though distinctive in some ways, the evolution of the franchise in America is similar to that in other countries: highly contested, with retreats as well as advances, containing within it the sharp reflections of larger struggles for power. America's basic claim to exceptionalismDearly white manhood suffrageDwas, according to Keyssar, part historical accident and part mistake, adopted before a European-style urban working class emerged. Keyssar identifies four periods: one of expansion from the Constitution's signing to around 1850; a period of contraction lasting until around WWI, in which the upper and middle classes demonstrated hostility to universal suffrage; a period of mixed, minor adjustments lasting till the 1960s, when the fourth period beganDthe civil rights movementDwhich inaugurated the removal of most of the remaining barriers. Various historical dynamics, such as economic development, immigration and class relations, underlie this periodization, expressed, Keyssar says, in shifting ideologies: voting as a right versus voting as a privilege or trust, while lack of financial independence was repeatedly used to justify excluding whole categories of voters. These large background shifts outline the tortured ebb and flow of suffrage: the post-Civil War enfranchisement of blacks and its rollback, the 70-year struggle for women's suffrage, the restoration of black voting rights in the 1960s. This is a masterful historical account of a complex, contradictory legacy. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Teacher You Want to Be: Essays about Children, Learning, and Teaching</h2><p><p>This book is about bringing the education we want for our own children to all.

One of the best ways is to understand users' reasons for doing things. Mental Models gives you the tools to help you grasp, and design for, those reasons. Adaptive Path co-founder Indi Young has written a roll-up-your-sleeves book for designers, managers, and anyone else interested in making design strategic, and successful.<p> TESTIMONIALS</p><p> "Indi Young's mental models are the perfect way for your team to integrate your user's perspective into your design.

I'll be giving this book out to all of our important clients and insisting they make it part of their process."<br> Jared Spool, CEO &amp; Founding Principal, User Interface Engineering</p><p> "Developed over the course of more than ten years, Indi Young's common sense approach focuses on user behavior, diagrammatic representations, and the participation of all stakeholders in collaborative discovery. It is a book that designers and students, alike, will find useful."<br> Richard Buchanan, Professor of Design, School of Design, Carnegie Mellon University</p><p> "Indi Young's new book is a welcome addition, covering an aspect of the design process that is extremely important but often neglected. The book is chock-full of practical advice derived from real-world development projects, but doesn't lose sight of the broad conceptual underpinnings."<br> Ray Valdes, Research Director, Web Services, Gartner Inc.</p><p> "Indi Young gives great insight into the nuts and bolts of understanding, capturing and visualizing user needs. Her "how to" instructions provide clear guidance for teams wishing to undertake a serious effort to architect, design and develop products with the user in mind."<br> Sara L. Beckman, Haas School of Business, University of California Berkeley</p><p></p></p><p>Indi&#39;s work spans a number of decades, from the mid-80&#39;s when the desktop metaphor was replacing command line and menu-based systems, to the mid-90&#39;s when the Web first toddled onto the scene, to now, when designers are intent on crafting good experiences. After 10 years of consulting, Indi founded Adaptive Path with six other partners in 2001, all hoping to spread good design around the world, making things easier for people everywhere. Indi&#39;s mental models have helped both start-ups and large corporations discover and support customer behaviors they didn&#39;t think to explore at first. She has written a book about the mental model method, Mental Models - aligning design strategy with human behavior, published by Rosenfeld Media. She is now consulting independently, conducting mental model workshops, and mentoring.There's a passion for mental models in this book which is contagious, even to an existing supporter of the concept. --Joanna Bawa, Usability News<br><br>I think it is a must read for design teams. When using Indi Young's mental models in your process you will without a doubt improve the quality of your products for the target audience. --Jeroen van Geel, Johnny Holland<br><br>Those in the social sciences will revel in its qualitative and intuitive approach, yet those in the hard science will appreciate its straightforward and simplistic tone. --Marisa Peacock, CMSWire</p><h2>Introduction to Global Studies</h2><p>This textbook provides a multidisciplinary introduction to Global and International Studies.

True worship, however, is our response to God's gracious revelation; in order to be acceptable to God, worship must be experienced on God's terms.<br><br>Respected Old Testament scholar Daniel Block examines worship in the Bible, offering a comprehensive biblical foundation and illuminating Old Testament worship practices and principles. He develops a theology of worship that is consistent with the teachings of Scripture and is applicable for the church today. He also introduces readers to a wide range of issues related to worship. The book, illustrated with diagrams, charts, and pictures, will benefit professors and students in worship and Bible courses, pastors, and church leaders.</p><p>"This is the kind of work we have come to expect from Daniel Block. It is comprehensive in virtually every avenue: biblically, theologically, historically, and practically. Whether discussing ancient temple worship or the twenty-first-century church, Block provides insightful critique as well as sound counsel for the way forward into authentically faithful worship of the Triune God. <i>For the Glory of God</i> is certain to have wide use in the academy, the church, and the lives of individuals--all for the glory of God and the good of the church."<br>--<b>Daniel L. Akin</b>, president, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>"In <i>For the Glory of God</i>, Daniel Block brings his theological and biblical expertise to bear on Christian worship. Block provides a thorough review of the Old and New Testament evidence, and his applications are informed by a wide variety of Christian forms and theologies of worship, ranging across the history of Christianity and denominational variations.&nbsp;Sometimes provocative but always informative, this work should form the starting point for the study and especially the practice of that most important of purposes for which God created us."<br>--<b>Richard S. Hess</b>, Denver Seminary<br><br>"Daniel Block's book is truly a tour de force on the theology and practice of worship. Featuring rich exegetical and theological insight, Block's analysis of key biblical texts challenges the contemporary church to think more biblically about the nature of true worship and to establish practices of worship that are rooted in Scripture."<br>--<b>Carol M. Kaminski</b>, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary<br><br>"<i>For the Glory of God</i> is a study of worship that seeks a biblical theology and eschews mere pragmatism. Especially helpful is Block's close attention to both Testaments and to the debates of church history--though the Western church is better covered than the East. Here is a conscientious scholar with a pastor's heart, whose work will benefit worshipers in general and church leaders in particular, even those who do not agree with all of his conclusions."<br>--<b>Edith M. Humphrey</b>, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary<br><br>"This is an amazing volume. The author is a seasoned and celebrated Old Testament scholar who has managed to write an encyclopedic and in-depth biblical theology of worship that covers virtually every conceivable element of the topic. At the same time, he has written this book in a way that speaks understandably to contemporary issues in the church. This will be a key resource for scholars, pastors, and lay people for decades to come."<br>--<b>Richard E. Averbeck</b>, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School"Daniel Block is one of the most knowledgeable, thoughtful, and prolific teachers of the Old Testament writing today. In this important book, he turns his attention to the crucial question of worship. He rightly insists that the question is not whether we enjoy worship but rather whether God is pleased with our worship. He brings his impressive understanding of the Bible to bear on the question of proper worship. The result is an insightful study of worship that has practical implications for all."<br>--<b>Tremper Longman III</b>, Westmont College<br><br>"This book is a scholar's gift to the church. Block's ability to analyze and synthesize the biblical texts is surpassed only by his passion in challenging us to fresh insights. Biblical scholars and theologians will appreciate his thorough study. Pastors and other worship leaders will wonder how they ever got along without it. We are all in his debt."<br>--<b>John H. Walton</b>, Wheaton College<br><br>"<i>For the Glory of God</i>&nbsp;returns consideration of Christian worship to its theological source: the Scriptures. There is no firmer starting point. We would do well to heed Block's advice to start at the source and to let Scripture guide us in worshiping God both within and without the walls of our church buildings."<br>--<b>Clay Schmit</b>, provost, Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, Lenoir-Rhyne University<br><br>"Vital and faithful worship practices are shaped by a wide variety of Christian leaders. How heartening it is that over the past several years biblical scholars have given new priority to helping us faithfully study and savor what the Bible says about worship. Block's evangelical, gospel-focused contribution to this conversation is both vigorous and accessible and will be useful in both academic and congregational settings."<br>--<b>John D. Witvliet</b>, Calvin Institute of Christian Worship, Calvin College and Calvin Theological Seminary<br><br>"In this accessible, comprehensive resource, world-class Old Testament scholar Daniel Block presents a complete biblical theology for the worship of God. With its careful exegesis of the Bible, clear understanding of ancient Near Eastern culture, and practical suggestions for the local church, <i>For the Glory of God</i> is destined to become an essential text for putting God at the center of worship."<br>--<b>Philip G. Ryken</b>, president, Wheaton College</p><h2>Omen (Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi, Bk 2)</h2><p>The Jedi Order is in crisis. The late Jacen Solo&#x2019;s shocking transformation into murderous Sith Lord Darth Caedus has cast a damning pall over those who wield the Force for good: Two Jedi Knights have succumbed to an inexplicable and dangerous psychosis, criminal charges have driven Luke Skywalker into self-imposed exile, and power-hungry Chief of State Natasi Daala is exploiting anti-Jedi sentiment to undermine the Order&#x2019;s influence within the Galactic Alliance. <br><br> Forbidden to intervene in Jedi affairs, Luke is on a desperate mission to uncover the truth behind Jacen&#x2019;s fall to the dark side&#x2013;and to learn what&#x2019;s turning peaceful Jedi into raving lunatics. But finding answers will mean venturing into the mind-bending space of the Kathol Rift and bargaining with an alien species as likely to destroy outsiders as deal with them. Still, there is no other choice and no time to lose, as the catastrophic events on Coruscant continue to escalate. Stricken by the same violent dementia that infected her brother, Valin, Jedi Knight Jysella Horn faces an equally grim fate after her capture by Natasi Daala&#x2019;s police. And when Han and Leia Solo narrowly foil another deranged Jedi bent on deadly destruction, even acting Jedi Grand Master Kenth Hamner appears willing to bow to Daala&#x2019;s iron will&#x2013;at the expense of the Jedi Order.<br><br>But an even greater threat is looming. Millennia in the past, a Sith starship crashed on an unknown low-tech planet, leaving the survivors stranded. Over the generations, their numbers have grown, the ways of the dark side have been nurtured, and the time is fast approaching when this lost tribe of Sith will once more take to the stars to reclaim their legendary destiny as rulers of the galaxy. Only one thing stands in their way, a name whispered to them through the Force: <i>Skywalker.</i></p><p><b>Christie Golden</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than thirty novels, including <i>Star Wars: Dark Disciple </i>and the <i>Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi </i>novels<i> Omen, Allies, </i>and<i> Ascension. </i>Her media tie-in works include launching the Ravenloft line in 1991 with <i>Vampire of the Mists, Fable: Edge of the World, </i>more than a dozen <i>Star Trek</i> novels, and multiple World of Warcraft and StarCraft novels, including <i>World of Warcraft: Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects</i> and <i>StarCraft II: Devils&#x2019; Due</i>.<i>Kesh<br>Two Years Earlier<br></i><br><br>The ocean sighed as it rushed forward and receded in&nbsp;a rhythm even more ancient than what was unfolding&nbsp;on its lavender- sand shores. While the sun was bright&nbsp;and warm, a breeze came from the sea to cool the&nbsp;heated faces of the two figures standing there.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;They faced each other, as still as if they were carved&nbsp;from stone, the only motion around them that of their&nbsp;hair and heavy black robes as the wind toyed with&nbsp;them.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Then, as if by some unheard signal, one of them&nbsp;moved. The soft sound of the ocean was punctuated by&nbsp;a sharp <i>snap- hiss. </i>The almost perfectly symmetrical,&nbsp;light purple features of Vestara Khai&#x2019;s adversary were&nbsp;abruptly cast into sickly green relief. Vestara activated&nbsp;her own weapon with a fluid motion, saluted her opponent&nbsp;with it, settled into position, and waited to see&nbsp;who would make the first move. She balanced lightly&nbsp;on the balls of her booted feet, ready to leap left, right,&nbsp;or straight up. Still her opponent did not move.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The sun was at its height and its light was harsh,&nbsp;beating down on them like something physical. Their&nbsp;heavy dark robes were stifling hot, but Vestara would&nbsp;no sooner abandon her robes than she would abandon&nbsp;her weapon or her heritage. The robes were traditional,&nbsp;ancient, a deep and valued part of who she was, and she&nbsp;would endure the encumbrance. The Tribe valued&nbsp;strength as much as it valued beauty; rewarded patience&nbsp;as much as initiative. The wise being was the one who&nbsp;knew when which was called for.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Vestara sprang.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Not at her opponent, but to the left and past him,&nbsp;leaping upward, turning in the air, and slashing outward&nbsp;with the blade. She felt the blade impact and&nbsp;heard its distinctive sizzle. He gasped as she landed,&nbsp;flipped, and crouched back into a defensive position.&nbsp;The sandy surface was treacherous, and her foot&nbsp;slipped. She righted herself almost instantly, but that&nbsp;moment was all he needed to come at her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He hammered her with blows that were more of&nbsp;strength than grace, his lithe body all lean muscle. She&nbsp;parried each strike, the blades clashing and sizzling, and&nbsp;ducked underneath the final one. Lightness and agility&nbsp;were her allies, and she used them freely.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Her long, light brown hair had come loose from its&nbsp;quickly twisted braid, and the tendrils were a distraction.&nbsp;She blew upward to clear her vision just in time to&nbsp;block another one of the strong blows.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�Blast,� she muttered, leaping back and switching the&nbsp;blade to her other hand. She was completely ambidextrous.&nbsp;�You&#x2019;re getting good, Ahri.�&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Ahri Raas, apprentice, member of the native&#x2013; and&nbsp;conquered&#x2013; species of Keshiri and Vestara Khai&#x2019;s close&nbsp;friend, offered her a smile. �I&#x2019;d say the same about you,&nbsp;Ves, except for the fact that that sand- jump messes you&nbsp;up every single ti&#x2013;�&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>She interrupted him with a sudden upward leap, landing&nbsp;on his shoulders, balancing there lightly with the use&nbsp;of the Force, and plunged the lightsaber straight downward,&nbsp;aiming for his back between his shoulder blades.&nbsp;He dived forward, Force- pushing her off, but not before&nbsp;she had touched the tip of the glowing red blade to&nbsp;his robes. Ahri arched, his dive thrown off as his body&nbsp;twisted from the pain; even the training lightsabers inflicted&nbsp;a powerful shock.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Vestara leapt as Ahri dived, using his Force push to&nbsp;her own advantage, turning twice in the air and landing&nbsp;surely, facing him. She smirked in satisfaction as she&nbsp;brushed her renegade locks out of the way. Ahri completed&nbsp;his dive and came to his feet, rolling in the sand.&nbsp;Vestara extended her arm with the grace of a dancer.&nbsp;Ahri&#x2019;s lightsaber was snatched from his hand and flew&nbsp;into hers. She grasped it and dropped into the Jar&#x2019;Kai&nbsp;stance, ready to come at him with both blades. Ahri&nbsp;looked up and sighed, dropping back into the sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�And you get distracted far too easily. Focus, Ahri,&nbsp;focus,� she chided. She gestured casually, just a slight&nbsp;jerk of her chin, and a handful of sand flew toward&nbsp;Ahri&#x2019;s face. Muttering, he lifted his empty hand and&nbsp;used the Force to deflect the grains.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�It&#x2019;s just training, Ves,� he muttered, getting to his&nbsp;feet and dusting himself off.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�It&#x2019;s <i>never </i>just training,� she shot back. She deactivated&nbsp;her training lightsaber, hooked it back on her&nbsp;belt, and tossed Ahri&#x2019;s to him. The Keshiri youth caught&nbsp;it easily, still looking disgruntled. Vestara undid her&nbsp;hair and fluffed it for a minute, letting the air penetrate&nbsp;to the roots to cool her scalp. Her long fingers busily rebraided&nbsp;it, properly this time, as she continued to&nbsp;speak, while Ahri shook grains of purple sand out of&nbsp;his own white, shoulder- length hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�How often have I told you that? Say that in the presence&nbsp;of one of the Masters and you&#x2019;ll never make it beyond&nbsp;a Tyro.�&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Ahri sighed and rose, nodding to acknowledge the&nbsp;truth of what she said. Neither of them had been formally&nbsp;chosen as an apprentice yet, although they had&nbsp;been training in classes under the tutelage of various&nbsp;Masters for years, their strengths and weaknesses in the&nbsp;Force noted and analyzed and pushed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Vestara knew that, at fourteen, it was still possible,&nbsp;even likely, that she would be chosen by a Master as his&nbsp;or her formal apprentice. But she chafed horribly at the&nbsp;delay. Some Tyros were chosen at much younger ages,&nbsp;and Vestara knew that she was strong in the Force.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>She reached out for a flask of now warm water and&nbsp;the canteen resting on the sand floated to her, the lid unfastening&nbsp;as it moved. Vestara gulped down the liquid&nbsp;thirstily. Sparring at the height of the sun was exhausting,&nbsp;and Ahri always muttered about it, but she knew it&nbsp;toughened her. Vestara handed the canteen to Ahri,&nbsp;who also drank.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;She regarded him for a moment. He was a nearly perfect&nbsp;physical specimen of a species whose physical strength,&nbsp;agility, and harmony of features and form had become&nbsp;an ideal for her own people. He could easily pass for a&nbsp;member of her own species&#x2013; he would make a striking&nbsp;human, but a human nonetheless&#x2013; were it not for the&nbsp;pale purple cast to his skin. His eyes, too, were slightly&nbsp;larger than a human&#x2019;s; large and expressive. His shoulders&nbsp;were broad, his hips narrow, and there was not an&nbsp;ounce of superfluous fat on his frame. His face,&nbsp;though, was flushed a darker purple than usual because&nbsp;he was overheated, and his hair had far too&nbsp;much sand in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�That&#x2019;s two for two,� she said. �You up for another&nbsp;round?� She gave him a wicked grin, which was exaggerated&nbsp;by the small scar at the corner of her mouth.&nbsp;<br><br>The scar that the Tribe saw as a flaw. It was plain on her&nbsp;face, right out in the open&#x2013;there was very little she&nbsp;could do to disguise it. Attempts had been made to heal&nbsp;it and to correct it with cosmetic surgery. Those attempts&nbsp;had been mostly successful and now, to be sure,&nbsp;it was not all that noticeable. But this was a world&nbsp;where any flaw, any scar or deformity, was a strike&nbsp;against one&#x2019;s potential for advancement.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;The scar added insult to injury, as far as Vestara was&nbsp;concerned&#x2013; because of its location, the thin line almost&nbsp;always made her look like she was smiling, even when&nbsp;she wasn&#x2019;t. She had hated that about it until Lady&nbsp;Rhea, one of the most respected of the Sith Lords, had&nbsp;told her that deception was actually a very useful thing&nbsp;indeed.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;�It mars your beauty,� Lady Rhea had said bluntly,&nbsp;pausing as she strolled down the line of potential apprentices&nbsp;after a formal ceremony. �A pity.� She, whose&nbsp;beauty was only slightly diminished by the cruel ravages&nbsp;of time, reached out a long finger and touched the&nbsp;scar. �But this little scar&#x2013; it can aid you. Make others&nbsp;think you are <i>something you are not.</i>� She tapped the&nbsp;scar lightly with each of the last four words, emphasizing&nbsp;her point.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;That had made Vestara feel a bit better. All of a sudden,&nbsp;looking like she was smiling all the time, even&nbsp;when she wasn&#x2019;t, seemed like a good thing to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�I think I&#x2019;ve sweated off at least two liters already,�&nbsp;Ahri replied. �Can&#x2019;t we continue in the training courtyard&nbsp;at least? It&#x2019;s cooler in the mountain shadows.�&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;At least he wasn&#x2019;t refusing the offer of another round.&nbsp;Vestara dragged a black- draped arm across her own&nbsp;forehead. She had to admit, fighting in the cool shadows&nbsp;of the proud columns, beautiful statuary, and sheer&nbsp;mountain stone in which the Temple courtyard was&nbsp;nestled had a definite appeal right at the moment.&nbsp;While they were not yet formally apprenticed to any of&nbsp;the Sabers or the Masters, as Tyros they would be per-&nbsp;mitted to spar in the courtyard. That was as far as they&nbsp;were allowed to go, however. Neither of them had seen&nbsp;inside the Temple or, even more significant, inside the&nbsp;Ship of Destiny yet. The ship&#x2019;s name was <i>Omen, </i>but the&nbsp;name �Ship of Destiny� had fallen into common usage.&nbsp;For such it was. Such an ancient, precious part of the&nbsp;Tribe&#x2019;s heritage, with all its secrets and mysteries, was&nbsp;not just for any eyes.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;�Well,� Vestara said, �we can go back and finish&nbsp;there. But only because you&#x2019;re too fragile to&#x2013;�&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Her teasing insult died in her throat as something&nbsp;passed over the sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It was not an uvak, one of the deceptively delicate&nbsp;winged reptiles that were used for aerial transportation.&nbsp;Vestara&#x2019;s dark brown eyes widened in shock.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�Ves,� Ahri said in a faint voice, �that&#x2019;s . . . is that a&nbsp;<i>ship</i>?�&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;The hairs on her arms and the back of her neck stood&nbsp;on end despite the heat as she watched, lifting a hand to&nbsp;shade her eyes. She still couldn&#x2019;t speak, but nodded. She&nbsp;was pretty sure that was exactly what the thing in the&nbsp;sky was.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Yet it looked nothing like the Ship of Destiny, or any&nbsp;other vessels she had seen depicted or heard described.&nbsp;Rather than being long and rectangular, or V- shaped, it&nbsp;was a symmetrical sphere. With . . . with wings like an&nbsp;uvak. It moved swiftly and silently, and she now saw&nbsp;that its color was a dark orange- red. Closer and closer&nbsp;it came, until for a wild moment Vestara thought it was&nbsp;going to land right on the beach beside them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It was coming in for a landing, certainly, but not quite&nbsp;so close as that. It was heading for the sharp, ridged&nbsp;mountains that seemed to spring up from the ocean itself.&nbsp;That was where the Ship of Destiny had crashed so&nbsp;long ago, and for a moment Vestara was alarmed that&nbsp;this vessel would suffer the same fate. Sudden worry&nbsp;suffused her. It couldn&#x2019;t! She had to know who was inside,&nbsp;what sort of beings they were. Perhaps they were&nbsp;a species she had never before encountered. The&nbsp;thought was thrilling.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As it passed over, its shadow fell across her for an instant.&nbsp;A sensation of coldness, much more than the expected&nbsp;sudden coolness of something blocking direct&nbsp;sunlight, brushed Vestara. She gasped slightly as the&nbsp;feeling tingled through her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It was cold, yes, forbidding . . . but also challenging.&nbsp;Curious. Intrigued.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>By <i>her.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;<br><br>She no longer was afraid for the vessel&#x2019;s safety. Its&nbsp;pilot knew exactly what it was doing. It was heading&nbsp;directly and quite deliberately for the ruins of the Ship&nbsp;of Destiny, and the Temple, almost as old, that had&nbsp;been constructed around it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Any fear or trepidation she had experienced a moment&nbsp;before evaporated like water on a hot rock. Vestara&nbsp;reached out in the Force and summoned Tikk, her&nbsp;uvak. Tikk had been basking in the sunlight, craving&nbsp;the heat as all reptiles did, his sharp beak and brilliant&nbsp;green eyes closed. Now he lifted his bright gold head,&nbsp;stretched out his long neck, and spread his red- andblack&nbsp;ruff in the uvak equivalent of an awakening&nbsp;stretch. With an answering croak, he spread his wings,&nbsp;leapt upward, and flew the few meters toward Vestara&nbsp;and Ahri.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>She barely paid attention to Tikk, keeping her eyes&nbsp;glued to the strange vessel as it grew smaller and finally&nbsp;vanished from her sight. When she could see it no&nbsp;longer, Vestara took a deep, steadying breath, then&nbsp;gathered up the long hem of her robes, turned to where&nbsp;Tikk patiently awaited her, and began to run as fast as&nbsp;her long legs would carry her in the cumbersome sand,&nbsp;using the Force to stabilize her feet and push her along.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�Come on,� she called over her shoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�Where are we going?� asked Ahri, hastening to&nbsp;catch up.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Vestara Force- leapt upward, landing gracefully on the&nbsp;broad back of the uvak. Ahri followed suit, his arms&nbsp;slipping around her waist as he sat behind her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�To follow the ship,� Vestara said. �Couldn&#x2019;t you feel&nbsp;it? It was for us, Ahri.�&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Tikk gathered himself, shifting his weight from one&nbsp;clawed foot to the other, then sprang upward.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�For us?� Ahri shouted over the beat of the membranous,&nbsp;veined wings&#x2013; wings so very like those of the vessel&nbsp;that had brushed Vestara&#x2019;s thoughts only a few&nbsp;heartbeats earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�For us,� Vestara repeated firmly. She didn&#x2019;t know&nbsp;how she knew, only that she did.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The vessel had come for them. For younglings. For&nbsp;apprentices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It had come for Sith.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It was not a very great distance as an uvak flew to the&nbsp;Sith Temple. Accessible only from the air or by a perilous&nbsp;climb, the Temple had been created to protect and&nbsp;watch over the Ship of Destiny and house the survivors&nbsp;of the crash. Vestara had visited here many times before,&nbsp;ever since she had become a Tyro. But she was&nbsp;more excited now than she had been even on her first&nbsp;trip so long ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Tikk&#x2019;s leathery wings beat steadily, and the Temple&nbsp;came into view. It had been hewn from the very rock&nbsp;that had been the destruction of the Ship of Destiny&#x2013;&nbsp;the <i>Omen. </i>It was very much like the Sith, Vestara&nbsp;thought, to take that which had been responsible for&nbsp;their greatest hardship and make it serve them. She&nbsp;knew the history ...</p><h2>How to Be Happy All the Time</h2><p>The human drive for happiness is one of our most far-reaching and fundamental needs. Yet, despite our desperate search for happiness, according to a recent Gallup Poll, only a minority of North Americans describe themselves as ?very happy.? It seems that very few of us have truly unlocked the secrets of lasting joy and inner peace. Now, in this volume of all-new, never-before-released material, Paramhansa Yogananda? who has hundreds of thousands of followers and admirers in North America?playfully and powerfully explains virtually everything needed to lead a happier, more fulfilling life. Topics covered include: looking for happiness in the right places; choosing to be happy; tools and techniques for achieving happiness; sharing happiness with others; balancing success and happiness, and many more. The Wisdom of Yogananda series features writings of Paramhansa Yogananda not available elsewhere. These books capture the Master?s expansive and compassionate wisdom, his sense of fun, and his practical spiritual guidance. The books include writings from his earliest years in America, in an approachable, easy-to-read format. The words of the Master are presented with minimal editing, to capture the fresh and original voice of one of the most highly regarded spiritual teachers of the 20th century.</p><p>This book offers you simple yet profound secrets for bringing happiness into your life in all circumstances. The thoughts are engaging, practical, and deeply inspiring. The author, Paramhansa Yogananda, came to the United States from India in 1920, bringing Americans the teachings and techniques of yoga, the ancient science of soul-awakening. He was the first master of yoga to make his home in the West, and his Autobiography of a Yogi quickly became a worldwide bestseller, fueling the awakening fascination with Eastern teachings in the West. Yoga is the ancient science of redirecting one&#39;s energies toward spiritual awakening. In addition to bringing Americans the most practical and effective techniques for meditation, Yogananda applied these principles to all areas of life. He showed people how to approach life from a center of inner peace and happiness. He was a prolific writer, lecturer, and composer during the 32 years he lived in America. The quotations included in this book are taken from many of the lessons he wrote in the 1930s, from Inner Culture and East West magazines published before 1943, as well as from his original interpretation of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, edited by Swami Kriyananda, and from notes taken by Swami Kriyananda during his years living with Yogananda as a close disciple. Publisher&#39;s Note 9 Our goal in this book is to let the Master&#39;s spirit come clearly through, with minimal editing. Sometimes sentences have been deleted because of redundancy, sometimes words or punctuation have been changed to clarify the meaning. Most of what is included here is not available elsewhere. We sincerely hope that Yogananda&#39;s words will fill your life with greater peace, fulfillment, and true happiness.True happiness is not an "impossible dream." You can begin today to experience happiness flowing in all aspects of your life. Yogananda shares the truths that make this possible. <p>Paramhansa Yogananda (1893-1952), one of the most renowned and beloved yoga masters of the 20th centruy, is the author of the spiritual classic, Autobiography of a Yogi. One of the first teachers to bring yoga to the West, Yogananda emphasized direct inner experience of the Divine, which he called "Self-realization." His teachings are universal and offer a practical approach to inner awakening. </p><p>In his early years in America, Yogananda wrote several sets of lessons and many articles that are no longer widely in print. The writings in the Wisdom of Yogananda series are drawn from these sources.</p></p><h2>Alice Neel: Freedom</h2><p>One of the foremost American figurative painters of the twentieth century, it is not surprising that Alice Neel was a humanist&#x2014;she was fascinated by people. Known for her daringly honest portraits, Neel loved to paint people in all their complexities&#x2014;to penetrate and reveal their fears and anxieties, how they defiance and survival. She also loved to paint the unadorned human figure. Her nudes, in particular, explore the body with frankness while celebrating the individuality of each of her subjects, and they exemplify the freedom and courage with which she approached her work and her life. Through her paintings and works on paper, Neel was able to free herself from the expected inhibitions and crippling taboos that were placed on women and focus on the beauty and nuanced complexity of flesh and the human body. In their mastery of form, color, and implied social commentary, her nudes are as relevant today as when they were painted. Freedom documents the solo exhibition of the artist&#x2019;s work at David Zwirner in New York in 2019. Including works that span the 1920s to the 1980s, this presentation focuses primarily on the nude figure&#x2014;whether male or female, adult or child&#x2014;and demonstrates how Neel rebelled against and challenged the traditional perceptions of sexuality, motherhood, and beauty in our society. The catalogue includes newly commissioned scholarship by Helen Molesworth and an introduction by Ginny Neel of The Estate of Alice Neel.</p><p>Alice Neel was born in 1900 in Merion Square, Pennsylvania, and died in 1984 in New York. With a practice spanning the 1920s to the 1980s, Neel is widely regarded as one of the foremost American figurative painters of the twentieth century. Based in New York, Neel chose her subjects from her family, friends, and a broad variety of locals, and her eccentric selection was thus a portrayal of, and dialogue with, the city in which she lived. Although she showed sporadically early in her career, from the 1960s onwards her work was exhibited widely in the United States. In 1974, she had her first retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.Innumerable nudes are scattered across millennia of art history, but none look like Alice Neel&#x2019;s.

For the foods of Italy, explained David, expanded far beyond minestrone and ravioli, to the complex traditions of Tuscany, Sicily, Lombardy, Umbria, and many other regions. David imparts her knowledge from her many years in Italy, exploring, researching, tasting and testing dishes. Her passion for real food, luscious, hearty, fresh, and totally authentic, will inspire anyone who wishes to recreate the abundant and highly unique regional dishes of Italy.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Elizabeth David (1913&#x2013;1992) published eight books during her lifetime, from the evocative <b>Book of Mediterranean Food</b> in ration-bound 1950 to the masterly <b>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</b> in 1977. Her books are acclaimed not only for their recipes but also for their literary depth. <b>French Provincial Cooking</b> and <b>Italian Food</b> were reissued as Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics in 1999.<p>TWENTIETH-CENTURY CLASSICS</p><p><b>ITALIAN FOOD</b></p><p>Elizabeth David discovered her taste for good food and wine when she lived with a French family while studying history and literature at the Sorbonne. A few years after her return to England she made up her mind to learn to cook so that she could reproduce for herself and her friends some of the food that she had come to appreciate in France. Subsequently, Mrs David lived and kept house in France, Italy, Greece, Egypt and India, as well as in England. She found not only the practical side but also the literature of cookery of absorbing interest and studied it throughout her life.</p><p>Her first book, <i>Mediterranean Food</i>, appeared in 1950. <i>French Country Cooking</i> followed in 1951, <i>Italian Food</i>, after a year of research in Italy, in 1954, <i>Summer Cooking</i> in 1955 and <i>French Provincial Cooking</i> in 1960. These books and a stream of often provocative articles in magazines and newspapers changed the outlook of English cooks forever.</p><p>In her later works she explored the traditions of English cooking (<i>Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen</i>, 1970) and with <i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</i> (1977) became the champion of a long overdue movement for good bread. <i>An Omelette and a Glass of Wine</i> (1984) is a selection of articles first written for the <i>Spectator, Vogue, Nova</i> and a range of other journals. The posthumously published <i>Harvest of the Cold Months</i> (1994) is a fascinating historical account of aspects of food preservation, the worldwide ice-trade and the early days of refrigeration. <i>South Wind Through the Kitchen</i>, an anthology of recipes and articles from Mrs David&#x2019;s nine books, selected by her family and friends and by the chefs and writers she inspired, was published in 1997, and acts as a reminder of what made Elizabeth David one of the most influential and loved of English food writers.</p><p>In 1973 her contribution to the gastronomic arts was recognized with the award of the first Andr� Simon memorial prize. An OBE followed in 1976, and in 1977 she was made a Chevalier de l&#x2019;Ordre du M�rite Agricole. In the same year <i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</i> won Elizabeth David the Glenfiddich Writer of the Year award. The universities of Essex and Bristol conferred honorary doctorates on her in 1979 and 1988 respectively. In 1982 she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and in 1986 was awarded a CBE. Elizabeth David died in 1992.</p><p></p><p>Elizabeth David</p><p><b>Italian Food</b></p><p>REVISED EDITION</p><p>PENGUIN BOOKS</p><p></p><p><b>CONTENTS</b></p><p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p><p>THIS 1987 edition of <i>Italian Food</i> differs from several of its predecessors chiefly in that revisions made over many years in the form of footnotes to recipes have now been incorporated into the main body of the text. References to numerous shops, at one time sources of supply of imported Italian foodstuffs, but now vanished, have been eliminated. When it came to my original chapter on the wines of Italy I found that almost everything I wrote in 1954 had receded into history. In fact already by the 1970s it wasn&#x2019;t only the variety and diversity of Italian wines available to us in England which had changed beyond recognition, it was the entire Italian wine industry which had undergone a revolution.</p><p>In 1954, and I suppose until 1960 or thereabouts, we bought unidentified&#x2014;and perhaps unidentifiable&#x2014;Chiantis, flabby Soaves and rough Valpolicellas, plus the odd bottle of Marsala kept handy for concocting a little sauce for a veal piccata or to add the necessary alcoholic kick to a zabaglione. Then one day, when writing this book, I came across a reference by Andr� Simon, at the time the most revered of wine gurus, to white Orvieto, a wine of which I had affectionate memories. But all that Andr� could find to say about it was that it made a good accompaniment to pineapple. That struck me, and strikes me still, as uncommonly unhelpful, not to say insulting to a wine which at its best has much character and which even at its worst would hardly be improved by marriage with so sharp and acid a fruit as pineapple. I realized that the attitude of French experts such as Andr� to Italian wine and, although to a slightly lesser degree, to Italian food, was uncurably patronizing. Only the French&#x2014;oh well perhaps at a pinch the Germans too&#x2014;knew how to make wine, only the French could compose and cook a decent meal. The realization of what that attitude implied wasn&#x2019;t encouraging to someone already fully committed to the writing of a full-length book on the cooking of Italy. Well, it was no time to turn back. At last, in November 1954 the book crept into print, predictably too late for reviews in the Christmas numbers of the monthlies. One piece of news, a Recommendation by the Book Society&#x2014;unheard of at that time for a cookery book&#x2014;was cheering, and eventually there were enthusiastic reviews, two of them by writers of the stature of Freya Stark and Margaret Lane. I am still grateful to those two much respected authors for their support, all the more so because although I had never met them I was aware that in both cases their knowledge of the subject would have justified sharp criticism had either of them felt inclined to make it.</p><p>The mid-1950s, it must be said, were not the most propitious times for the sales of cookery books. Food rationing, first imposed in 1939, came to an end only in the summer of 1954, and many ingredients vital to Italian cookery returned very gradually. Maybe you could at last buy veal, but if your butcher knew how to cut escalopes you were lucky. The purchase of a supply of olive oil, and for that matter even a small amount of Parmesan in the piece, entailed a bus trip to the Italian provision shops of Soho and heavily laden shopping bags to tote home. Still, the efforts involved did make cooking and entertaining in those days very rewarding and enjoyable. Then came the early sixties, the heyday of Italian fashion, Italian knitwear, Italian furniture, Enzo Apicella&#x2019;s Italian trattorias, in short of anything Italian from Parma ham to Ferragamo shoes. It was in 1963, at the height of Italy-fever, that Penguin books acquired <i>Italian Food</i> for paperback publication, but it was not until 1971 that the same firm judged that popular interest in Italian wine was growing sufficiently to justify a paperback edition of Cyril Ray&#x2019;s <i>Wines of Italy.</i> To the best of my knowledge this was the first English book, and Cyril Ray the first English author, to treat the subject in depth. Italian wines were at last to be taken seriously by English wine experts and English wine merchants.</p><p>Apart from a brief new chapter on Italian wines written for this 1987 edition, together with a list of English-language books on the same subject, for those interested there are much expanded lists of Italian cookery books, of guides to food and wine in Italy, and of relevant reference books. A list entirely new to this edition is one which I have called Visitors&#x2019; Books, in other words a selection from the accounts written by scores of English and French visitors to Italy from the end of the fifteenth century down to the 1980s. This list gives hardly more than a hint of the vast range of relevant books&#x2014;shamefully, for example, I now see that I have omitted any mention of Stendhal, most celebrated of French observers of the Italian scene. My only excuse for that and any other omissions of similar enormity is that my lists were compiled while I was in hospital and without benefit of reference to my own books or of a check in libraries.</p><p>To my original Introduction I have made only one significant revision, and that concerns the paragraph dealing with the influence on French cookery traditionally exercised by Catherine de Medici and the Florentine cooks she is said to have brought with her to France. Those cooks, I now find, are part of a myth originating in mid-nineteenth-century France, perhaps in the imagination of one of the popular historical novelists who flourished at that period, and certainly without existence in historical fact. As briefly as possible, what <i>is</i> historical fact is that when Catherine arrived in France in 1533 to marry Henri Duke of Orleans, younger brother of the Dauphin, she was fourteen years old, had barely emerged from the Florentine convent in which she had been brought up, and had already been granted French nationality. All her attendants were French.</p><p>Whatever the Italian influence exercised on French cultural life in general and on culinary developments in particular by Catherine&#x2019;s marriage to the boy who was later to become Henri II of France, that transalpine influence had already been active at least since the end of the previous century. It was Charles VIII, King of France from 1483 to 1498, and indirect predecessor of Catherine&#x2019;s father-in-law, Fran�ois Icr, who had imported Italian gardeners to recreate in the Loire valley gardens such as he had seen in Italy, and to cultivate in France the attractive green vegetables, the garden peas, the cauliflowers, the spinach, some say even the artichokes, which had so impressed him in Italy when in 1495 he had attempted, unsuccessfully, to seize the Kingdom of Naples. One of those imported gardeners, Paolo di Mercogliero, had even planted orange trees in the grounds of the royal Ch�teau Gaillard, not in an orangery, but over-optimistically in the open air. Unsurprisingly, the trees never bore fruit.</p><p>Catherine&#x2019;s own reign as Queen Consort, and for thirty more years as Queen Dowager&#x2014;many of them as officially recognized Regent&#x2014;from 1559 until her death in 1589 did inevitably coincide with a great deal of artistic and cultural activity on the part of Italians working in France. Jewellers, glove-makers, sugar-workers, pastrycooks, confectioners, were brought from Italy by Catherine during the years of her widowhood. One of her pastrycooks is credited with the invention or at any rate with the introduction of flaky pastry, but then so are other personages, among them the much later painter Claude Lorraine, who is said to have learned how to make it in Rome. Many food historians would say that some form of fine-leaved pastry had been known at least since the days of the Romans, and I think they would be right, but equally I have doubts about the claim that Catherine&#x2019;s pastrycooks made their <i>feuillet�</i> with butter rather than with oil or lard. One does not hear much about the use of butter in France at this period. But then almost as many legends are attached to Catherine&#x2019;s name as later became encrusted around that of Napoleon. In Catherine&#x2019;s case, many of the stories, whether apocryphal or factual, do point to the advanced state of civilized life in Italy as compared with that of France in the first half of the sixteenth century, and to the improvements achieved by the French during the second half. That some of those improvements were directly due to Catherine and her Italian craftsmen and architects, cooks and confectioners is undeniable. To credit her with all of them would be a distortion of history.</p><p>E.D. 1987</p><p><b>INTRODUCTION TO THE</b></p><p><b>FIRST EDITION</b></p><p>THE origins of Italian cooking are Greek, Roman, and to a lesser extent, Byzantine and oriental.</p><p>The Romans, having evolved their cookery from the sane traditions of Greece, proceeded in the course of time to indulge in those excesses of gluttony which are too well known to bear repetition here; but what must in fact have been a considerable understanding of the intricacies of cookery has been overlooked in the astonishment of less robust ages at their gigantic appetites and at the apparently grotesque dishes they consumed. Owing to the necessities of preservation, a good deal of the food of those days must have been intolerably salt; to counteract this, and also presumably to disguise a flavour which must often have been none too fresh, the Romans added honey, sweet wine, dried fruit, and vinegar to meat, game, and fish, which were, besides, heavily spiced and perfumed with musk, amber, pepper, coriander, rue.</p><p>Similar methods of cookery prevailed in all the more primitive parts of Europe until the nineteenth century, when the development of rapid transport began to make the large-scale salting and pickling of food unnecessary. In Italy Roman tastes are still echoed in the <i>agrodolce</i> or sweet-sour sauces, which the Italians like with wild boar, hare and venison. The Roman taste for little song-birds&#x2014;larks, thrushes and nightingales&#x2014;also persists in Italy to this day; so does the cooking with wine, oil, and cheese, and the Roman fondness for pork, veal, and all kinds of sausages.</p><p>When all the arts of a civilized world were swept away by the waves of barbarism which engulfed Europe after the final extinction of the Roman Empire, the art of cooking also vanished, surviving only in the books preserved in the monasteries. With the fifteenth-century renaissance of art and letters, fostered by the great families of Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, Genoa, and Naples, came the renewal of interest in the food and cooking of classical times. The first printed culinary work, written by Bartolomeo Sacchi, librarian at the Vatican, appeared about 1474; it is a sign of the great interest displayed in the subject that the book, called <i>Platina de honesta voluptate et valetudine vulgare</i>, usually known as Platina&#x2019;s book, was printed in six different editions within the next thirty years.</p><p>Some twenty years after the first printing of Sacchi&#x2019;s book the so-called book of Apicius was printed in Milan (1498; there had been an earlier printed edition of this work undated, in Venice). This was the cookery book purporting to contain fragments of the culinary writings of Marcus Apicius, noble and erudite Roman gourmet of the time of Tiberius. Apicius is said to have derived his gastronomic learning from Greek cookery books and to have founded a school devoted to the culinaryarts. His own manuscript was in fact lost, and the work which was printed under his name was derived from notes supposed to have been written by one of his pupils; these notes were copied, apparently, two hundred years after the death of Apicius. (Having spent a vast fortune in the course of a dissolute life, he committed suicide at the age of fifty-five, about A.D. 30, rather than be forced to modify his way of living.) Throughout the Middle Ages various copies of the manuscript were made.</p><p>These enthusiastic studies of Greek and Roman methods of cooking found expression in the vast banquets and displays of gorgeous splendour with which the Doges of Venice, the Medici, the Este, the Borgia, the Visconti, the Sforza, the Doria, and the rest of the powerful Italian rulers impressed each other, the populace, and foreign potentates.</p><p>The spice trade, which had originated with the Phoenicians and never entirely died out, had a lasting influence on Italian cookery. Spices from the East Indies, Southern India, and Ceylon were shipped from Calicut, on the south-west coast of India, via the Red Sea port of Jidda to Suez; from Suez they were transported across the desert to Cairo, thence down the Nile to Rosetta; from Rosetta the cargoes were shipped to Alexandria, from Alexandria to Venice and to Genoa.

Weber has also written highly popular collaborations, including his Starfire Series with Steve White, which produced the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Shiva Option</i> among others<i>. </i>Weber&#x2019;s collaboration with alternate history master Eric Flint led to the bestselling <i>1634: The Baltic War, </i>and his planetary adventure novels with military science fiction ace and multiple national best-seller John Ringo includes the blockbusters <i>March to the Stars </i>and<i> We Few. </i>Finally, Weber&#x2019;s teaming with Linda Evans produced the bestselling<i> </i>Multiverse series. David Weber makes his home in South Carolina with his wife and children.<br> <br> <b>Jane Lindskold</b> is the award-winning, bestselling author of over twenty novels, including the incredibly popular Firekeeper series <i>(Through Wolf&#x2019;s Eyes</i> though <i>Wolf&#x2019;s Blood)</i>, as well as over sixty shorter works of science fiction and fantasy. Several of her novels have been chosen by VOYA for their Best SF, Fantasy and Horror list. Lindskold's work has been repeatedly praised for its sensitive depiction of worlds and cultures different from our own -- especially those that aren't in the least human. Her works have been praised as "intricate, beautifully written" (<i>Voya</i>), "attention-grabber" (<i>School Library Journal</i>), "engrossing" (<i>Miami Herald</i>), "Thrilling" (<i>Publisher's Weekly</i>), "ripping good fantasy" (<i>Kliatt</i>). Reviewer Charles deLint called Lindskold "one of those hidden treasures of Amerian letters." She has been a frequent contributor to the Honorverse, where her tales of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Michael have a loyal and enthusiastic following.Now that the Fire Season on Sphinx is over, Stephanie Harrington and her fellow provisional ranger Karl are offered the unique chance to study in the forestry service program on the nearby planet Manticore. It&#x2019;s an exciting opportunity, and while Stephanie worries how it will affect her burgeoning romance with the dashing Anders, it&#x2019;s too good to pass up, especially given that the program is accommodating her unique relationship with the treecat Lionheart, with which she is deeply bonded. Of course, nothing is as simple as it appears, and both Steph and Karl are soon caught up in the political intrigue centered around the treecats. This continuation of the Star Kingdom series may leave newcomers a bit lost, but as the authors&#x2019; nimbly build the background of Weber&#x2019;s Honorverse, the history and complex connections will fall into place, and those who missed the series&#x2019; start, A Beautiful Friendship (2011), will want to follow up and discover what they missed.

I knew it with a single sip.<br> <br>That someone was about to die.<br> <br>I glanced around the crowded presence chamber, hoping to spot the doomed idiot who thought to poison a Diabolic. This was hardly the first attempt on my life in the harried days since Tyrus&#x2019;s coronation. There&#x2019;d been the young Grande Austerlitz, who tried to stab me in a surprise attack. I&#x2019;d been bemused enough to tolerate his clumsy slashes for a few moments.<br> <br>It seemed wise to be diplomatic, so I gave him a chance. &#x201c;Stop this at once,&#x201d; I told him, dodging his next slash, his next.<br> <br>He just bared his teeth and dove at me. I sidestepped him and hooked his ankle in mine to flip his legs out from under him. He screamed out as he tried to launch himself back to his feet&#x2014;so I delivered a kick to his head that broke his skull open.<br> <br>Days passed before the next attempt. This one had been a fanatical junior vicar. She gave away her intentions with the shout of, &#x201c;Abomination!&#x201d; just before she tried to pull me into the air lock with her.<br> <br>I tore from her grip and batted her away, knocking her into the air-lock shaft. The blast doors sealed closed behind her&#x2014;clearly some automated timer she&#x2019;d set up in advance&#x2014;and I met her eyes in the split second before the door to space popped open behind her and vented her into the darkness.<br> <br>When criminals were vented to space for execution, the onlookers were supposed to turn their backs and look away. It was a gesture of deliberate disrespect. The condemned were so unworthy, even their deaths wouldn&#x2019;t be watched.<br> <br>For this bold woman who&#x2019;d attacked me, I felt a strange desire to watch her float away. She&#x2019;d seen the fate of Austerlitz and still mounted a direct attack. This was the least I could do for one of such daring. There were a great many Grandiloquy who loathed me, a great many Helionics who scorned me with every righteous fiber of their being, but few were bold enough to act upon their malice.<br> <br>Helionics viewed creatures like me as subhumans. The &#x201c;dan&#x201d; in our names meant we were beneath them in status, yet now their new Emperor meant to wed me. They would have to kneel to a creature. A Diabolic.<br> <br>The assassination attempts weren&#x2019;t a surprise to me; the infrequency of the attempts was. A mere three attempts on my life in ten days? It was actually somewhat disappointing.<br> <br>I welcomed the familiarity of feeling in danger. It tightened my focus, made my heart pick up a beat. My gaze swept the crowd as I drew the goblet to my lips, because surely my would-be assassin was fool enough to watch me drink this poison.<br> <br>Yet I realized in moments that too many eyes were fixed on me to guess which pair might belong to my poisoner. I should have realized it at once. After all, everywhere I went now, I was watched, I was scrutinized, I invited discussion and opinion.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do they ever tire of staring?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d wondered the first night after the coronation, when I&#x2019;d noticed the unnatural degree of scrutiny.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is just life as a Domitrian,&#x201d; Tyrus told me.<br> <br>So my assassin . . . There were too many candidates. The crowd for the Day of Pardon was simply too thick, and there was no guessing who&#x2019;d meant to end my life. Too many of these people watching me probably wished to do it.<br> <br>Then a familiar pair of pale eyes met mine, and Tyrus inclined his head toward the exit, telling me silently that we needed to part ways with this company of Grandiloquy. It was time for the ceremony, which we would spend with the Excess.<br> <br>I dipped my head in acknowledgment. The Day of Pardon would be held in the Great Heliosphere. It was an important imperial holiday, one of the few aimed at pleasing the Excess, who lived on planets, rather than the ruling Grandiloquy space dwellers.<br> <br>On this day, Tyrus would enjoy the Emperor&#x2019;s privilege of commuting the prison sentences of several Excess who&#x2019;d converted to the Helionic faith. I aimed for the exit, knowing Tyrus would meet me there. Then my steps stilled as I passed a cluster of revelers gathered before Tyrus&#x2019;s cousin and her husband.<br> <br>I always took note of those who flocked to the Successor Primus, Devine�. She was Tyrus&#x2019;s last immediate relative and consequently heir to his throne. In my eyes, she was the greatest threat he faced. I&#x2019;d damaged her mind beyond healing, so she couldn&#x2019;t plot on her own behalf, but others could use her as a puppet. Had it been up to me, she&#x2019;d be dead already. It was Tyrus&#x2019;s decision, though. She was the last of his family, and I&#x2019;d disabled her. He&#x2019;d view her murder as monstrous.<br> <br>And then . . .<br> <br>Then the realization crawled into my mind: there was a weapon of murder in my hand that could not be blamed on me or traced back to me.<br> <br>I made up my mind. I walked over to my intended&#x2019;s sole living relative. As my shadow slid over her, her foggy gaze rose to mine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, Your Eminence. Are you enjoying the festivities?&#x201d; I said pleasantly, looming above her.<br> <br>Devine� blinked up at me dully, unable to comprehend me. I set down my goblet seemingly offhandedly, just beside hers. I made a show of unwinding my elaborate twist of currently chestnut brown hair, then arranging it anew (unnecessary with the hair stilts that arranged my locks in any style, but many women fussed over hair anyway).<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine conversation,&#x201d; I said to Devine�. &#x201c;We must speak again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then I plucked up her goblet, leaving mine behind. And so quickly, so easily, it was done. I headed out to meet Tyrus for the ceremony, hoping that by the time it concluded, we&#x2019;d hear news of it: confirmation of the death of his deadliest foe.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>&#x201c;You look beautiful,&#x201d; Tyrus murmured to me as we neared the heliosphere.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>We were both wearing reflective garments of silver, interwoven with veins of liquid crystal. Though I&#x2019;d gone with auburn hair and a darker skin tone, Tyrus looked the same as always, pale and lightly freckled, with clever pale eyes and light, sharply angled eyebrows crowned with tousled red hair.<br> <br>Just outside the Great Heliosphere, I hesitated. It wasn&#x2019;t like me to be nervous, and I wasn&#x2019;t, per se. . . . But I just knew I was about to commit an obscenity, marching into the Great Heliosphere and taking an honored place during the ceremony.<br> <br>Tyrus guessed the turn of my thoughts. He leaned in closer to me, dropping his voice. &#x201c;There will be no issue with zealots today. We&#x2019;re not broadcasting this live, so we can edit any incidents out of the transmission. We&#x2019;ve also borrowed a vicar. This is a holiday for the Excess, so they comprise the audience. They will be more favorably disposed toward us.&#x201d;<br> <br>He meant toward me.<br> <br>Of course he did. Tyrus had been careful with every move of his reign so far, since he was the sort to think ten steps ahead before making a single one. I&#x2019;d been eased slowly into public life over the last weeks.<br> <br>First the galaxy was transmitted glimpses of me from the dramatic scene at the coronation, when Tyrus declared his love for me and embraced me before all, consigning his grandmother to death in my place. My prisoner&#x2019;s garb had been modified in the transmission to a lovely, tasteful set of rags, and my unpigmented hair to a mane of effervescent gold. I looked a lost princess from a tale, not a Diabolic.<br> <br>The transmission was effective in one respect: Cygna had received all the blame&#x2014;rightfully&#x2014;for the late Emperor Randevald&#x2019;s death.<br> <br>The galaxy received just that glimpse of me, enough to set the Excess on their planets across the empire wondering who I could be, wondering what story lay behind my appearance in public life. Tyrus believed the best way to strip a secret of its power was to glare a shining light on it from the angle of choice, to exhibit it fearlessly rather than seek to hide it. He followed up on that first glimpse by introducing me as his future Empress&#x2014;and a Diabolic&#x2014;at his first Convocation.<br> <br>Thousands gathered in person on the Valor Novus, the central starship of the Chrysanthemum, and avatars from light-years away appeared to fill the rest of the seats in the Grand Sanctum. It was the greatest chamber on the vessel and only used on such occasions as the first time a new Emperor addressed the powerful of his realm.<br> <br>Tyrus planted the question about me with one of his allies, and then gave his prepared answer: &#x201c;My fianc�e will be a symbol of the new era we begin here today. Her name is Nemesis dan Impyrean. Some will be scandalized that I have no intention of wedding a member of this Empire&#x2019;s elite. I say, let them be scandalized, for I love Nemesis above any other. She is the most honest, courageous, and worthy candidate I can imagine as the Empress of this galaxy, and I know you will come to admire her as I have.&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;d had the sound dampened in certain parts of the chamber in advance, anticipating the stir of voices. Many of the traditional objectors, though, dared do nothing but cheer. Tyrus had taken Helionic prisoners at his coronation. He intended to release them now that the danger of his grandmother was past&#x2014;provided their relatives in the Senate showed themselves cooperative in this transmission. Thus, those few objections were squelched, whereas sound was amplified from those allies Tyrus could count on to cheer and applaud.<br> <br>Every major figure in the galactic media of Eurydice received a personal message from Tyrus. He&#x2019;d greeted each of them, and his words included the &#x201c;coded language&#x201d; indicating they were to support me cheerfully in public.<br> <br>Before more questions could be asked, he forged onward to his lofty hopes about restoring the sciences to tackle the menace of malignant space. This time he selectively muted the Grandiloquy so the cheering of the Excess could be heard. Airing both of his most scandalous intentions at once divided the outrage, as he&#x2019;d hoped.<br> <br>Then, on a final note, when cheering swelled at the conclusion of his first Convocation speech, Tyrus reached out, took me by the hand, and drew me to his side to exhibit me at the very finest. Far from my natural, colorless albinism, I appeared hued with brilliant black hair and bronzed skin, stenciled with effervescent glow over the cheekbones, in a gleaming dress of cascading gold sheets.<br> <br>A beautiful woman, not a Diabolic. That&#x2019;s how I appeared.<br> <br>Yet illusion could only get us so far. I knew that in my heart.<br> <br>Now, here we were at this first real test of whether my public image was being received as Tyrus hoped. With Excess in the audience, they&#x2019;d hopefully be too amazed to find themselves at this great event to bother dwelling on who&#x2014;or rather, what&#x2014;I was.<br> <br>Tyrus and I stepped into the Great Heliosphere. I was painfully conscious of every single flicker of my lashes, every twitch of my muscles. Now that everyone knew how human I was not, it had become more essential to seem human than ever before.<br> <br>The crowd within the Great Heliosphere lapsed into silence as we drew into the sacred chamber of diamond and crystal, and then they were dropping to their knees, hands to their hearts in salute to the Emperor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rise,&#x201d; Tyrus said. He never kept them lingering on their knees as Randevald had been wont to do.<br> <br>We moved through the parted sea of bodies, and Tyrus glimpsed Astra nu Amador, a nervous young vicar who worked for Senator von Amador.<br> <br>Tyrus inclined his head in silent thanks to Astra. She returned it with a smile. She was ambitious enough to see that she might become Vicar Primus if she impressed us, replacing Fustian nan Domitrian. Tyrus and Fustian had been at odds since the coronation, when Fustian refused to bless me. Fustian would not have performed this ceremony with me present.<br> <br>Now, as I raised my eyes to take in our surroundings, the sheer force of the light blasting in through the windows truly registered, though it cast only a faint warmth over my skin. The heliosphere was designed to refract starlight in myriad ways for services. No mirrors were needed to amplify the starlight this close to the red hypergiant star, Hephaestus, for the Ritual of Pardon.<br> <br>So large, so bright was Hephaestus that the distant, smaller stars of the Cosmos were drowned out against the black. The crowd would have appeared but silhouettes against the great blaze of its light, but for the glowing pigment under their skin that set their features in stark relief. I didn&#x2019;t recognize any of the faces.<br> <br>We stood alone in the innermost circle as the Vicar Astra set about placing sacred chalices throughout the chamber.<br> <br>The Excess prisoners shuffled inside in a silent line. They&#x2019;d all converted to the Helionic faith in prison, and they were the fortunate dozen due to be pardoned this year as reward for their penitence.<br> <br>Tyrus&#x2019;s role in this ceremony was brief. He stepped forward, and the men and women knelt before him, displaying their pitifully bared heads, where they&#x2019;d shaved away their hair to exhibit their faith. He spoke the short litany of pardon, and then the vicar took it from there.<br> <br>Astra moved between the converts to aid them in shedding their clothing. Then she led each of the converts by the hands to the window to position them in the glare of the sacred hypergiant. The naked men and women pressed up against the window, spreading their arms, their fingers, soaking light into every square centimeter of their skin.<br> <br>Tyrus took my arm, nudged me gently, and we stepped back, and back, as the vicar slowly adjusted the optics so more light from the hypergiant could seep into the chamber.<br> <br>Then the hypergiant&#x2019;s light grew so bright, it seemed to lance into my pupils. The white skein of starlight scorched my eyes, and my hand flew up instinctively to protect my face. Through the veil over my vision, I heard the rustle of other people raising their hands to do the same. Then heat followed, a great, terrible wave of it that pummeled the air about us, stinging my skin, and I knew it was too much heat.<br> <br>Something was wrong.<br> <br>The pardoned men and women scrambled back from the windows, dark silhouettes contorting as their terrible screams knifed the air. The vicar&#x2019;s garb flared ablaze and the oil chalices spouted columns of heat.<br> <br>I comprehended several things all at once: flames, hundreds of bodies all about me, and one exit.<br> <br>This was a death trap.</p><h2>Naked in Baghdad: The Iraq War and the Aftermath as Seen by NPR&#39;s Correspondent Anne Garrels</h2><p><p>As National Public Radio's much loved and respected senior foreign correspondent Anne Garrels has covered conflicts in Chechnya, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. In <i>Naked in Baghdad</i> she reveals how as one of only sixteen non-embedded journalists who stayed in the now legendary Palestine Hotel throughout the American invasion she managed to deliver the most immediate, insightful and independent reports with unparalleled vividness and immediacy.<br>Her evolving relationship with her Iraqi driver/minder Amer, and the wonderful e-mail bulletins sent to friends by her husband, Vint Lawrence, counterpoint the daily events of her life in Baghdad, and result in a deeply moving, and intimate portrait by one of bravest and most enlightening news reporters.</p></p><p><p><b>Anne Garrels</b> has been a foreign correspondent for NPR since 1988. She is the recipient of numerous major awards including the International Women's Media Foundation's Courage in Journalism in 2003.</p>Anne Garrels of National Public Radio was one of only 16 "non-embedded" foreign journalists who remained in Baghdad throughout the 2003 Iraqi War. Her diary-style story about that war is one of the few eyewitness accounts we are likely to have. It's riveting--filled with stories of the surreal Iraqi bureaucracy, noble and devious Iraqis, generous and backstabbing journalists, wrong-headed American politicos, and the fascinating labor of getting the news and getting it out to her listeners. Garrels's confident, warm voice is as suited to reading her own book as it is suited to reporting. She delivers a story full of inflection and emotion without ever becoming overwrought. Her reports are interspersed with the eloquent e-mail reports that her husband, artist Vint Lawrence, sent to friends during Garrels's absence. Lawrence reads stiffly and undoubtedly would have improved with some critiqued practice. Yet, he writes beautifully, and his reports are essential. This is an all-round terrific listen.

Foreword by Anne Morrow Lindbergh; Index; photographs.<br></p><p>James Newton (1905-1999) had a long career as real estate developer, conservationist, cowboy, soldier, corporate executive, labor dispute negotiator, and friend par excellence.Now in his 80s, real-estate developer Newton recalls with uncritical admiration five celebrated men with whom he enjoyed almost filial relationships. According to the author, they all shared the same philosophy of life, enouncing business principles in terms of moral precepts. Newton's bonds with Carrel and with the scientist's friend and partner in medical research, Lindbergh, were forged by their common interest in metaphysics. The narrative is studded with anecdotes about the nature of these men: Edison's assertion that his deafness was an asset; Ford's dictum that profit is essential to business vitality; Firestone's advocacy of Japanese-style "consensus" management; Carrel's expectation of encountering Aristotle after death; and Lindbergh's revulsion at the destruction wrought by aviation in WW II. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Next-Level Spiritual Warfare: Advanced Strategies for Defeating the Enemy</h2><p>Does it seem as though your prayers aren't being answered?

Campbell&#x2019;s insights highlight centuries of confusion between literal and metaphorical interpretations of Western religious symbols that are, he argues, perennially relevant keys to spiritual understanding and mystical revelation.</p><p><b>Joseph Campbell</b> (1904&#x2013;1987) is widely credited with bringing mythology to a mass audience. His works, including the four-volume <i>The Masks of God</i> and <i>The Power of Myth</i> (with Bill Moyers), rank among the classics in mythology and literature. <b>Eugene Kennedy, PhD</b> is a psychologist, syndicated columnist, and a professor emeritus of Loyola University Chicago. A laicized Catholic priest, he has written over fifty books on psychology, religion, the Catholic church, and the psychology of religion.<br>This collection of essays, lectures and discussions will delight both avid Campbell disciples eager for more of his thoughts and newcomers to his work on comparative mythology and religion. It is also a quick refresher course on some of Campbell's ideas about the Judeo-Christian tradition for those who have encountered him in his well-known Hero with a Thousand Faces or in his popular television series on the power of myth with Bill Moyers. This is not the polished writing of a scholar systematically presenting an argument. Rather, editor Kennedy urges the reader to approach this collection "as one would the classroom, or the study" in order to better enjoy the more energetic and spontaneous "master teacher" side of Campbell. The effect is to take the reader on a romp through the Judeo-Christian tradition a lightning-paced tour with an extremely knowledgeable and provocative guide to illuminate some intriguing, untrammeled paths. The most abiding theme of this collection is that Western religious traditions have suffered from taking their stories and symbols literally instead of metaphorically. Some chapters are dense with ideas and call for careful reading, while other sections are breathtakingly clear in describing mind-opening concepts. In either case, this is a book that will stretch readers to reconsider their interpretation of the stories and symbols of faith and the relationship between personal spirituality and institutional religion. (Oct. 15)Forecast: Although Campbell died in 1987, there is still tremendous interest in his work, which bodes well for this title, the first in New World Library's Collected Works of Joseph Campbell series.

These traps, they say, can erupt in any organizational environment. Some of these traps distort our perception of right and wrong&#x2015;so we actually believe our unethical behavior is right. Many of them are psychological in nature, and if we are not aware of them they are like illusions&#x2015;webs of deception. In the authors' analysis, these traps significantly contributed to the large-scale corporate disasters we witnessed in recent years. Hoyk and Hersey take account of these realities and offer a "real-world" method that will predict, preclude, and, if necessary, "get us out of" these traps. Given the increased scrutiny under which all executives and mangers operate today, this book is a 'must read' for anyone who is charged with achieving an organization's mission&#x2015;whether that mission is increasing profit, serving the common good, or both.</p><p>Robert Hoyk is a Clinical Psychologist and has conducted research in several institutions. He has taught communication skills to executives, physicians, and couples. Paul Hersey is Distinguished Professor of Leadership Studies at Nova Southeastern University. He co-authored, with Ken Blanchard, <i>Management of Organizational Behavior</i> (Prentice Hall)."<i>The Ethical Executive</i> is a must read for everyone. This book is clearly not just for managers or leaders, but should be read by all so as to avoid the traps that are pointed out in the text. <i>The Ethical Executive</i> can give individuals the experience of coping with ethical dilemmas before they arise. The book is clear and practical, and hence a quick read. It will save readers a lot of grief they could face in the future by knowing how to avoid ethical traps." &#x2015;Randolph A. Pohlman, Ph.D., Dean, H. Wayne Huizenga School of Business and Entrepreneurship, Nova Southeastern University<br><br>"This timeless and important book is a must read for leaders at every level in the organization. Whether you are a seasoned CEO or just starting out in business, this book will provide a roadmap for navigating the minefields of psychological self-deception and illusions that can trap good people, even those with strong ethical values, into moving towards disaster. Buy this book. Read it. Apply its concepts, models and theories to your own situation. Give it to your children. It's that important!" (Stephen LaCivita, Associate Dean of Executive Education <i>The University of Chicago Graduate School of Business</i>)<br><br>"If money is your only goal and that end justifies your means, dont buy this book. If personal character, ethical choices and self respect are integral aspects of your understanding of success, buy it. Dr. Hoyk and Dr. Hersey have gathered accessible wisdom to help you untangle the ethical knots of your job. They write to guide, encourage and help you in your choice to be true to the highest you know and aspire to." (Reverend Dr. H. William Gregory, Osher Lifelong Learning Institute <i>University of Southern Maine</i>)<br><br>"Drs Hoyk and Hersey have provided highly practical ways of achieving sustainable profitability through building a solid ethical foundation for your business. You will find their suggestions will create a climate of cooperation and mutual trust that will make every employee in your firm willing to achieve their very best." (Dewey E. Johnson, Professor Emeritus, Craig School of Business, California State University <i>Fresno</i>)<br><br>"If you rate yourself as more ethical than your colleagues, are you more likely than they are to act ethically in a real-world situation? To find the answer to this and many other interesting facts about ethical behavior, read this book. It is a delightful compendium of those impulses that lead perfectly good people to choose seemingly safe paths of no return&#x2015;and a guide to avoiding the first steps on a potentially disastrous journey." (Leslie S. Greenberg, Professor, Department of Psychology <i>York University</i>)<br><br>"Examining the headline-making moral lapses at Enron, Tyco International, Adelphia, World Com and other less-than-ethical business locales in the light of numerous psychological experiments, clinical psychologist Hoyk and professor Hersey illustrate in 45 breezy but beneficial lessons how we all face and fall victim to "day-to-day ethical traps. ...As the authors note, "[g]ood intentions are not enough," and this guide provides a useful, easy-to-read antidote for our unwitting corruptibility." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"I found this book to be refreshing. Rather than the academic posturing of ethical theory or the typical pabulum of business ethics rules, it approaches the potentials of unethical conduct in a concise, practical way. Readers will recognize many of the traps, but the book will both sensitize the reader to the traps and provide approaches that will keep them from getting caught in the traps. I recommend the book to all businesspeople." (John Stinson, Professor emeritus and former Dean, College of Business <i>Ohio University</i>)<br><br>"This book will not teach you how to be ethical, it will educate you to recognize the day-to-day ethical traps that we all face, analyze them and give the practical, usable information you need to respond in a way that supports good intention, fair decisions and abundant wealth. Whether you're a CEO, a lay person, an executive or a manager, knowledge of the traps described in this book will give you chance after chance to make substantial deposits in your self-esteem bank account."

His small body was writhing in the delivery of great, crimson oaths.<br><br>"Run, Jimmie, run! Dey'll get yehs," screamed a retreating Rum Alley child.<br><br>"Naw," responded Jimmie with a valiant roar, "dese micks can't make me run."<br><br>Howls of renewed wrath went up from Devil's Row throats. Tattered gamins on the right made a furious assault on the gravel heap. On their small, convulsed faces there shone the grins of true assassins. As they charged, they threw stones and cursed in shrill chorus.<br><br>The little champion of Rum Alley stumbled precipitately down the other side. His coat had been torn to shreds in a scuffle, and his hat was gone. He had bruises on twenty parts of his body, and blood was dripping from a cut in his head. His wan features wore a look of a tiny, insane demon.<br><br>On the ground, children from Devil's Row closed in on their antagonist. He crooked his left arm defensively about his head and fought with cursing fury. The little boys ran to and fro, dodging, hurling stones and swearing in barbaric trebles.<br><br>From a window of an apartment house that upreared its form from amid squat, ignorant stables, there leaned a curious woman. Some laborers, unloading a scow at a dock at the river, paused for a moment and regarded the fight. The engineer of a passive tugboat hung lazily to a railing and watched. Over on the Island, a worm of yellow convicts came from the shadow of a grey ominous building and crawled slowly along the river's bank.<br><br>A stone had smashed into Jimmie's mouth. Blood was bubbling over his chin and down upon his ragged shirt. Tears made furrows on his dirt-stained cheeks. His thin legs had begun to tremble and turn weak, causing his small body to reel. His roaring curses of the first part of the fight had changed to a blasphemous chatter.<br><br>In the yells of the whirling mob of Devil's Row children there were notes of joy like songs of triumphant savagery. The little boys seemed to leer gloatingly at the blood upon the other child's face.<br><br>Down the avenue came boastfully sauntering a lad of sixteen years, although the chronic sneer of an ideal manhood already sat upon his lips. His hat was tipped with an air of challenge over his eye. Between his teeth, a cigar stump was tilted at the angle of defiance. He walked with a certain<br>swing of the shoulders which appalled the timid. He glanced over into the vacant lot in which the little raving boys from Devil's Row seethed about the shrieking and tearful child from Rum Alley.<br><br>"Gee!" he murmured with interest, "A scrap. Gee!"<br><br>He strode over to the cursing circle, swinging his shoulders in a manner which denoted that he held victory in his fists. He approached at the back of one of the most deeply engaged of the Devil's Row children.<br><br>"Ah, what deh hell," he said, and smote the deeply-engaged one on the back of the head. The little boy fell to the ground and gave a hoarse, tremendous howl.</p><h2>The Universe of Peter Max</h2><p>Enter <em>The Universe According to Peter Max</em>.

This book reveals for the first time how it took critical shape at sea. Expanding the gaze even more widely, the book centers on how the oceanic transport of human cargoes--known as the infamous Middle Passage--comprised a violently regulated process foundational to the institution of bondage. Sowande&#39; Mustakeem&#39;s groundbreaking study goes inside the Atlantic slave trade to explore the social conditions and human costs embedded in the world of maritime slavery. Mining ship logs, records and personal documents, Mustakeem teases out the social histories produced between those on traveling ships: slaves, captains, sailors, and surgeons. As she shows, crewmen manufactured captives through enforced dependency, relentless cycles of physical, psychological terror, and pain that led to the making--and unmaking--of enslaved Africans held and transported onboard slave ships. Mustakeem relates how this process, and related power struggles, played out not just for adult men, but also for women, children, teens, infants, nursing mothers, the elderly, diseased, ailing, and dying. As she does so, she offers provocative new insights into how gender, health, age, illness, and medical treatment intersected with trauma and violence transformed human beings into the most commercially sought commodity for over four centuries.</p><p>How slave ships manufactured bondage from the raw material of humanitySowande&#39; M.

Something we didn&#x2019;t have but needed. Someone, to be precise. A ship&#x2019;s cook.</p><p>Our own ship&#x2019;s cook and his mate were both dead. The cook&#x2019;s mate had been caught pissing in the ballast, which I didn&#x2019;t allow and so punished him the traditional way, by making him drink a mug of the crew&#x2019;s piss. I must admit, I&#x2019;ve never had it happen before where the mug of punishment piss actually killed the man, but that&#x2019;s what happened with the cook&#x2019;s mate. He drank the mug of piss, went to sleep that night and never got up. Cook was all right by himself for a time, but he did like a nip of rum, and after a nip of rum was apt to take the night air on the poop-deck. I&#x2019;d hear him clomping about on the roof of my cabin, dancing a jig. Until one night I heard him clomping about on the roof of my cabin and dancing a jig&#x2014;followed by a scream and a splash.</p><p>The bell rang and the crew rushed to the deck, where we dropped anchor and lit lanterns and torches, but of Cook there was no sign.</p><p>They had lads working with them, of course, but they were just boys, none of them knew how to do anything more culinary-minded than stir the pot or peel some spuds, and we&#x2019;d been living on raw grub ever since. Not a man among us knew how to do so much as boil a pot of water.</p><p>Now, not long back we&#x2019;d taken a man-o&#x2019;-war. A tasty little excursion from which we&#x2019;d bagged ourselves a brand-spanking-new broadside battery and a holdful of artillery: cutlasses, pikes, muskets, pistols, powder and shot. From one of the captured crew, who then became one of my crew, I&#x2019;d learnt that the Dons had a particular supply ship on which served an especially adept cook. Word was that he&#x2019;d cooked at court but offended the queen and been banished. I didn&#x2019;t believe a word of that but it didn&#x2019;t stop me repeating it, telling the crew we&#x2019;d have him preparing our meals before the week was out. Sure enough we made it our business to hunt down this particular brig, and when we found it, lost no time in attacking it.</p><p>Our new broadside battery came in handy. We drew up alongside and peppered the brig with shot till she broke, the canvas in tatters and the helm splintered in the water.</p><p>She was already listing as my crew lashed and boarded her, scuttling over her sides like rats, the air heavy with the stink of powder, the sound of muskets popping and cutlasses already beginning to rattle. I was in among them as always, cutlass in one hand and my hidden blade engaged, the cutlass for melee work, the blades for close finishing. Two of them came at me and I made short of the first, driving my cutlass into the top of his head and slicing his tricorn in half as the blade cleaved his head almost in two. He went to his knees with the blade of my sword between his eyes but the problem was I&#x2019;d driven it too deep, and when I tried to wrench it free his writhing body came with it. Then the second man was upon me, terror in his eyes, not used to fighting, obviously, and with a flick of the blade I sliced off his nose, which had the desired effect of sending him back with blood spraying from the bloody hole where his beak had been, while I used two hands to finally wrench my cutlass out of the skull of the first attacker and continue the good fight. It was soon over, with as few of their crew dead as possible, me having given out special instructions that on no account was the cook to be harmed&#x2014;Whatever happens, I&#x2019;d said, we have to take the cook alive.</p><p>As their brig disappeared beneath the water and we sailed away, leaving a fog of powder-smoke and a sea of splintered hull and bobbing bits of broken ship behind us, we gathered their crew on the main deck to flush out the cook, hardly a man among us not salivating, his belly not rumbling, the well-fed look of their crew not lost on us. Not at all.</p><p>It was Caroline who taught me how to appreciate good food. Caroline my one true love. In the all-too-brief time we&#x2019;d spent together she refined my palate, and I liked to think that she&#x2019;d have approved of my policy towards the repast, and how I&#x2019;d passed on a love of the finer things to the crew, knowing as I did, partly due to what she&#x2019;d shown me, that a well-fed man is a happy man, and a happy man is a man less prone to questioning the authority of the ship, which is why in all those years at sea I never had one sniff of mutiny. Not one.</p><p>&#x201c;Here I am,&#x201d; he said, stepping forward. Except it sounded more like, &#x201c;Beer I bam,&#x201d; owing to his bandaged face, where some fool had cut off his nose.</p><br><p>Chapter Two</p><p>1711</p><p>But anyway, where was I? Caroline. You wanted to know how I met her.</p><p>Well, therein lies a tale, as they say. Therein lies a tale. For that I need to go much further back, to a time when I was just a simple sheep-farmer, before I knew anything of Assassins or Templars, of Blackbeard, Benjamin Hornigold, of Nassau or The Observatory, and might never have been any the wiser but for a chance meeting at the Auld Shillelagh one hot summer&#x2019;s day back in 1711.</p><p>The thing is, I was one of those young firebrands who liked a drink even though it got me into a few scrapes. Quite a few . . . incidents, shall we say, of which I&#x2019;m none too proud. But that&#x2019;s the cross you have to bear if you&#x2019;re a little over-fond of the booze; it&#x2019;s rare to find a drinker with a clean conscience. Most of us will have considered knocking it on the head at one time or another, reforming our lives and perhaps turning to God or trying to make something out of ourselves. But then noon comes around and you know what&#x2019;s good for that head is another drink, and so you head for the tavern.</p><p>The taverns I&#x2019;m referring to were in Bristol, on the south-west coast of dear old England, where we were accustomed to fierce winters and glorious summers, and that year, that particular year, the year that I first met her, 1711, like I say, I was just seventeen years old.</p><p>And, yes&#x2014;yes, I was drunk when it happened. In those days, you&#x2019;d have to say I was drunk a lot of the time. Perhaps . . . well, let&#x2019;s not exaggerate, I don&#x2019;t want to give a bad account of myself. But perhaps half of the time. Maybe a bit more.</p><p>Home was on the outskirts of a village called Hatherton, seven miles outside Bristol, where we ran a small holding keeping sheep. Father&#x2019;s interests lay with the livestock. They always had, so having me on board had freed him from the aspect of the business he most despised, which was making the trips into town with the merchandise, haggling with merchants and traders, bargaining, cutting deals. As soon as I&#x2019;d come of age, by which I mean, as soon as I was enough of a man to meet the eye of our business associates and trade as an equal, well, that&#x2019;s what I did. Father was all too glad to let me do it.</p><p>My father&#x2019;s name was Bernard. My mother, Linette. They hailed from Swansea but had found their way to the West Country when I was ten years old. We still had the Welsh accent. I don&#x2019;t suppose I minded much that it marked us out as different. I was a sheep-farmer, not one of the sheep.</p><p>Father and Mother used to say I had the gift of the gab, and Mother in particular used to tell me I was a good-looking young man, and that I could charm the birds off the trees, and it&#x2019;s true, even though I do say so myself, I did have a certain way with the ladies. Let&#x2019;s put it this way: dealing with the wives of the merchants was a more successful hunting-ground than having to barter with their husbands.</p><p>How I spent my days would depend on the season. January to May, that was lambing season, our busiest time, when I&#x2019;d find myself in the barns by sun-up, sore head or not, needing to see whether any ewes had lambed during the night. If they had, then they were taken into one of the smaller barns and put into pens, lambing jugs we called them, where Father would take over, while I was cleaning feeders, filling them up again, changing the hay and water, and Mother would be assiduously recording details of the new births in a journal. Me, I didn&#x2019;t have my letters then. I do now, of course; Caroline taught me them, along with much else that made me a man, but not back then, so that duty fell to Mother, whose own letters weren&#x2019;t much better but enough to at least keep a record.</p><p>They loved working together, Mother and Father. Even more reason why Father liked me going into town. He and my mother&#x2014;it was as though they were joined at the hip. I had never seen another two people so much in love and with so little need to make a display of the fact. It was plain to witness that they kept each other going. It was good for the soul to see.</p><p>In the autumn we&#x2019;d bring the rams through to the pasture to graze with the ewes, so that they could go on with the business of producing more lambs for the following spring. Fields needed tending to, fences and walls building and repairing.</p><p>In winter, if the weather was very bad, we brought the sheep into the barns, kept them safe and warm, ready for January, when lambing season began.</p><p>But it was during summer when I really came into my own. Shearing season. Mother and Father carried out the bulk of it while I made more frequent trips into town, not with carcasses for meat but with my cart laden with wool. In the summer, with even more opportunity to do so, I found myself frequenting the local taverns more and more. You could say I became a familiar sight in the taverns, in fact, in my long, buttoned-up waistcoat, knee-breeches, white stockings and the slightly battered brown tricorn that I liked to think of as being my trade-mark, because my mother said it went well with my hair (which was permanently in need of a cut but quite a striking sandy colour, if I do say so myself).</p><p>It was in the taverns I discovered that my gift of the gab was improved after a few ales at noon. The booze, it has that effect, doesn&#x2019;t it? Loosens tongues, inhibitions, morals. . . . Not that I was exactly shy and retiring when I was sober, but the ale, it gave me that extra edge. Or at least that&#x2019;s what I told myself at the time. After all, the money from extra sales made as a result of my ale-inspired salesmanship more than covered the cost of the ale in the first place. Or at least that&#x2019;s what I told myself at the time.</p><p>There was something else, too, apart from the foolish notion that Edward in his cups was a better salesman than Edward sober, and that was my state of mind.</p><p>Because the truth was, I thought I was different. No, I knew I was different. There were times I&#x2019;d sit by myself at night and know I was seeing the world in a way that was all my own. I know what it is now but I couldn&#x2019;t put it into words back then other than to say I felt different.</p><p>Either because of that or despite it, I&#x2019;d decided I didn&#x2019;t want to be a sheep-farmer all my life. I knew it the first day, when I set foot on the farm as an employee, and not as a child, and I saw myself, then looked at my father, and understood that I was no longer here to play and would soon go home to dream about a future setting sail on the high seas. No, this was my future, and I would spend the rest of my life as sheep-farmer, working for my father, marrying a local girl, siring boys and teaching them to become sheep-farmers, just like their father, just like their grandfather. I saw the rest of my life laid out for me, like neat work-clothes on a bed, and rather than feel a warm surge of contentment and happiness about that fact, it terrified me.</p><p>So the truth was, and there&#x2019;s no way of putting it more gently, and I&#x2019;m sorry, Father, God rest your soul, but I hated my job. And after a few ales, well, I hated it less, is all I can say. Was I blotting out my dashed dreams with the booze? Probably. I never really thought about it at the time. All I knew was that sitting on my shoulder, perched there like a mangy cat, was a festering resentment at the way my life was turning out&#x2014;or, worse, actually had turned out.</p><p>Perhaps I was a little indiscreet concerning some of my true feelings. I might on occasion have given my fellow drinkers the impression that I felt life had better things in store for me. What can I say? I was young and arrogant and a sot. A lethal combination at the best of times, and these were definitely not the best of times.</p><p>&#x201c;You think you&#x2019;re above the likes of us, do you?&#x201d;</p><p>I heard that a lot. Or variations of it, at least.</p><p>Perhaps it would have been more diplomatic of me to answer in the negative, but I didn&#x2019;t, and so I found myself in more than my fair share of fights. Perhaps it was to prove that I was better than them in all things, fighting included. Perhaps because in my own way I was upholding the family name. A drinker I might have been. A seducer. Arrogant. Unreliable. But not a coward. Oh no. Never one to shrink from a fight.</p><p>It was during the summertime when my recklessness reached its heights; when I would be most drunk and most boisterous, and mainly a bit of a pain in the arse. But on the other hand, all the more likely to help a young lady in distress.</p></p><h2>The Biopolitics of Feeling: Race, Sex, and Science in the Nineteenth Century (ANIMA: Critical Race Studies Otherwise)</h2><p>In <i>The Biopolitics of Feeling</i> Kyla Schuller unearths the forgotten, multiethnic sciences of impressibility&#x2014;the capacity to be transformed by one's environment and experiences&#x2014;to uncover how biopower developed in the United States. Schuller challenges prevalent interpretations of biopower and literary cultures to reveal how biopower emerged within the discourses and practices of sentimentalism. Through analyses of evolutionary theories, gynecological sciences, abolitionist poetry and other literary texts, feminist tracts, child welfare reforms, and black uplift movements, Schuller excavates a vast apparatus that regulated the capacity of sensory and emotional feeling in an attempt to shape the evolution of the national population. Her historical and theoretical work exposes the overlooked role of sex difference in population management and the optimization of life, illuminating how models of binary sex function as one of the key mechanisms of racializing power. Schuller thereby overturns long-accepted frameworks of the nature of race and sex difference, offers key corrective insights to modern debates surrounding the equation of racism with determinism and the liberatory potential of ideas about the plasticity of the body, and reframes contemporary notions of sentiment, affect, sexuality, evolution, and heredity.</p><p>Kyla Schuller is Assistant Professor of Women&#39;s and Gender Studies at Rutgers University, New Brunswick."[Schuller's] terminology here may act as a springboard for additional theorizations of race. . . . An ambitious, conscientious history." (Joshua Falek <i>Cultural Studies</i> 2018-06-08)<br><br>"The importance of this book to nineteenth-century studies cannot be understated: it fundamentally rewrites the history of sentimentalism, an affective and cultural formation that dominated norms of comportment and embodiment across the period. . . . " (Kyla Tompkins <i>American Quarterly</i> 2018-01-12)<br><br>"<i>The Biopolitics of Feeling</i> takes a refreshingly head-on approach to the historical entanglement of race and sex in the United States. . . Stunningly convincing . . .&nbsp;Readers will find an abundant resource of theoretically informed readings of postbellum and Progressive Era science and literature throughout the study, but they will be also unable to ignore Schuller&#x2019;s urgent warning about feminism&#x2019;s embeddedness in the machinations of biopower." (Britt Rusert <i>Catalyst</i> 2019-04-01)<br><br>"Impressibility and sentimentalism combine in this book to form a rubric assessing a broad and fascinating archive. . . . Schuller offers a broad view of how nineteenth-century Americans were given repeated exposure to the logic of impressibility and affective fitness, to the point where both became unconscious components of civic life."

And what a story it is: Through hundreds of original interviews, contemporary newspaper accounts, police reports, court testimony, and more, Legs McNeil and coauthors Jennifer Osborne and Peter Pavia trace today's billion-dollar industry from its makeshift, mob-connected origins to the Internet age. Along the way we encounter porn stars such as Linda Lovelace, John Holmes, Traci Lords, and Savannah -- along with countless mainstream stars, politicians, FBI agents, and more. </p><p>Epic, hilarious, and moving, <em>The Other Hollywood</em> contributes to the porn industry the one thing missing in all previous accounts: a vivid, tragicomic, irresistible humanity. </p></p><p>From the nudie cuties of the 1950s to celebrity porn in the late 1990s, <i>The Other Hollywood: The Uncensored Oral History of the Porn Film Industry</i> offers an insider's view of the adult film industry's transition from a shady, backroom business to a $10-billion-per-year money machine and mainstream acceptance. The story is told through interviews with hundreds of actors, directors, law enforcement officials, and other participants, all edited together with expert skill and pacing. <p> The industry exploded in the early 1970s with the success of the Mafia-backed <i>Deep Throat</i>, which reportedly grossed $100 million after an initial $22,000 investment. Featured at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973, the film ushered in the rise of "porno chic," making it fashionable, for a time, to take a date to a porn film. One industry insider described <i>Deep Throat</i> as "the <i>Blair Witch Project</i> of its time." Filled with sleazy intrigue, vivid details, and many heartbreaking--and even touching--stories, <i>The Other Hollywood</i> covers the actors, the numerous legal challenges to the industry, FBI sting operations, the Mafia connection, rampant drug use, rock stars, celebrities, the opposition by religious and political groups, the emergence of AIDS (that claimed the lives of porn superstars such as the famously endowed John Holmes), and the explosion of the video market and its overnight fortunes. Even at 600 pages, this is a quick and engrossing read that is hard to put down. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p><p>Legs McNeil is the coauthor of <em>Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk</em>, a book widely hailed as a classic of its kind.

Yet, little has been written about the type of care they provided or how midwifery and maternity care evolved under the increasing presence of local and federal health care structures.</p><p>Using evidence from nursing, medical, and public health journals of the era; primary sources from state and county departments of health; and personal accounts from varied practitioners, <i>Delivered by Midwives: African American Midwifery in the Twentieth-Century South</i> provides a new perspective on the childbirth experience of African American women and their maternity care providers. Author Jenny M. Luke moves beyond the usual racial dichotomies to expose a more complex shift in childbirth culture, revealing the changing expectations and agency of African American women in their rejection of a two-tier maternity care system and their demands to be part of an inclusive, desegregated society.</p><p>Moreover, Luke illuminates valuable aspects of a maternity care model previously discarded in the name of progress. High maternal and infant mortality rates led to the passage of the Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act in 1921. This marked the first attempt by the federal government to improve the welfare of mothers and babies. Almost a century later, concern about maternal mortality and persistent racial disparities have forced a reassessment. Elements of the long-abandoned care model are being reincorporated into modern practice, answering current health care dilemmas by heeding lessons from the past.</p></p><p>A history of African American childbirth experience and midwifery&#39;s renewed value in combating health disparities<b>Jenny M.

The repertoire of these dishes is vast and varied. In SUQAR, acclaimed chef Greg Malouf and writing partner Lucy Malouf share the best and most delectable sweet treats from the region (alongside some personal favorites and tried-and-tested creations from Greg's restaurant kitchens). The recipes merge the spices, flavors and scents of Greg's childhood with the influence of Greg's training in the West to create dishes in Greg's signature Modern Middle Eastern style.<br><br>The book's ten chapters cover: Fruit; Dairy; Frozen; Cakes; Cookies; Pastries; Doughnuts, Fritters &amp; Pancakes; Halvas &amp; Confectionery; Preserves; and Drinks. Accompanied by beautiful photography and illustrations, SUQAR is a journey through the sweets of the Middle East.</p><p>Acclaimed as the master of modern Middle Eastern cooking, Greg Malouf transformed the Australian restaurant scene over several decades with his innovative food. Greg's reputation as the creator of a new style of cooking known as Modern Middle Eastern - which has changed forever the perception of Middle Eastern food in the West - reaches far beyond his native Australia. Along with writing partner Lucy Malouf, he has produced nine (including SUQAR) beautiful and award-winning books on different cuisines, starting with Arabesque in 1999. In 2011, he was honoured as Ambassador by The American University in Beirut for his achievements in promoting Lebanese cuisine around the world. In 2012, Greg left the award winning MoMo restaurant in Melbourne, Australia, to take over the reins at the iconic Petersham Nurseries Caf� in Richmond, UK. His Middle Eastern take on seasonal dining earned the restaurant a Michelin star. He has since moved to the Middle East, and is now based in Dubai, where he oversees the kitchen at Zaahira, a 130-seat restaurant at the 5-star H Dubai Hotel, as well as consulting.

She has had a varied career, with jobs ranging from chamber maid, caterer and short-order cook, to educational psychologist and financial analyst. In 1998, she traded in her job with a Wall Street firm to pursue her passion for food by marrying a chef and becoming a waitress. Although neither of these moves proved successful, they were the starting point for a new career in food, travel and writing. The books he has created with Greg Malouf, her former husband, have been translated into multiple languages and are now published around the world. Lucy&nbsp;has also now returned to England, and lives in Kent, The Garden State, where she relishes country life.<b>WINNER</b> 2019 James Beard Foundation Book Award for Baking and Desserts</p><h2>Why Liberalism Works: How True Liberal Values Produce a Freer, More Equal, Prosperous World for All</h2><p><b>An insightful and passionately written book explaining why a return to Enlightenment ideals is good for the world</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The greatest challenges facing humankind, according to Deirdre McCloskey, are poverty and tyranny, both of which hold people back. Arguing for a return to true liberal values, this engaging and accessible book develops, defends, and demonstrates how embracing the ideas first espoused by eighteenth-century philosophers like Locke, Smith, Voltaire, and Wollstonecraft is good for everyone.<br> &nbsp;<br> With her trademark wit and deep understanding, McCloskey shows how the adoption of Enlightenment ideals of liberalism has propelled the freedom and prosperity that define the quality of a full life. In her view, liberalism leads to equality, but equality does not necessarily lead to liberalism. Liberalism is an optimistic philosophy that depends on the power of rhetoric rather than coercion<b>,</b> and on ethics, free speech, and facts in order to thrive.</p><p><b>Deirdre Nansen McCloskey</b> has been distinguished professor of economics and history and professor of English and communications at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

A textbook on the Old Testament should not deepen these attitudes, but work to replace them. They Spoke from God addresses the writings of the Old Testament in simple language and in a personal style that speaks directly to the reader. It not only provides the student with a basic grasp of relevant passages, it also relates the biblical text to historical, theological, and ethical questions. Most importantly, They Spoke from God demonstrates how the various portions of the Old Testament fit together with one another, held together by the story of a God at work to redeem his people.</p><p>Dr. William C.

Typically, books on the subject are either written by fundamentalist fear-mongers whose eschatology seems to come from the National Enquirer, or by their enemies, who soothe &#x201c;peace, peace&#x201d; when there is no peace, or by scholars who squint at gnats and swallow camels. Like Christ, this book will offend both Pharisees and Sadducees, both Herodian collaborators and Zealot revolutionaries.</p><p>The book is a wake-up call. It is utterly relevant to our times. A plethora of views that echo the words of Christ, of scripture, of the Fathers, and of modern writers such as Lewis, Chesterton, Tolkien, Ratzinger, John Paul II, Mother Teresa, Christopher Dawson, Josef Pieper, Cardinal Newman, and the Catechism. These are united in a harmonious chorus to tell us that we sit at the edge of an abyss which we have ignored or masked. We sit in the Titanic&#x2019;s deck chairs enjoying martinis.</p><p>When Catholics hear and heed the message of this book, and not before, she will recover the passion and energy of our ancestors who, when they looked into the future, saw both a great light and a great darkness, both glory and gore, both wonder and war, where we see only a vague fog. </p><p>&#x2014;Dr. Peter Kreeft, author of C.

However, in 387 he renounced all his unorthodox beliefs and was baptized into Christianity.

Great are you, O Lord, and exceedingly worthy of praise, your power is immense, and your wisdom beyond reckoning. And so we humans, who are a due part of your creation, long to praise you-we who carry our mortality about with us, carry the evidence of our sin and with it the proof that you thwart the proud. Yet these humans, due part of your creation as they are, still do long to praise you. You arouse us so that praising you may bring us joy, because you have made us and drawn us to yourself, and our heart is unquiet until it rests in you.<br><br> Grant me to know and understand, Lord, which comes first: to call upon you or to praise you? To know you or to call upon you? Must we know you before we can call upon you? Anyone who invokes what is still unknown may be making a mistake. Or should you be invoked first, so that we may then come to know you? But how can people call upon someone in whom they do not yet believe? And how can they believe without a preacher? But scripture tells us that those who seek the Lord will praise him, for as they seek they find him, and on finding him they will praise him. Let me seek you, then, Lord, even while I am calling upon you, and call upon you even as I believe in you; for to us you have indeed been preached. My faith calls upon you, Lord, this faith which is your gift to me, which you have breathed into me through the humanity of your Son and the ministry of your preacher.<br><br> 2, 2. How shall I call upon my God, my God and my Lord, when by the very act of calling upon him I would be calling him into myself? Is there any place within me into which my God might come? How should the God who made heaven and earth come into me? Is there any room in me for you, Lord, my God? Even heaven and earth, which you have made and in which you have made me-can even they contain you? Since nothing that exists would exist without you, does it follow that whatever exists does in some way contain you? But if this is so, how can I, who am one of these existing things, ask you to come into me, when I would not exist at all unless you were already in me? Not yet am I in hell, after all, but even if I were, you would be there too; for if I descend to the underworld, you are there. No, my God, I would not exist, I would not be at all, were you not in me. Or should I say, rather, that I should not exist if I were not in you, from whom are all things, through whom are all things, in whom are all things? Yes, Lord, that is the truth, that is indeed the truth. To what place can I invite you, then, since I am in you? Or where could you come from, in order to come into me? To what place outside heaven and earth could I travel, so that my God could come to me there, the God who said, I fill heaven and earth?<br><br> 3, 3. So then, if you fill heaven and earth, does that mean that heaven and earth contain you? Or, since clearly they cannot hold you, is there something of you left over when you have filled them? Once heaven and earth are full, where would that remaining part of you overflow? Or perhaps you have no need to be contained by anything, but rather contain everything yourself, because whatever you fill you contain, even as you fill it? The vessels which are full of you do not lend you stability, because even if they break you will not be spilt. And when you pour yourself out over us, you do not lie there spilt but raise us up; you are not scattered, but gather us together. Yet all those things which you fill, you fill with the whole of yourself. Should we suppose, then, that because all things are incapable of containing the whole of you, they hold only a part of you, and all of them the same part? Or does each thing hold a different part, greater things larger parts, and lesser things smaller parts? Does it even make sense to speak of larger or smaller parts of you? Are you not everywhere in your whole being, while there is nothing whatever that can hold you entirely?<br><br> 4, 4. What are you, then, my God? What are you, I ask, but the Lord God? For who else is lord except the Lord, or who is god if not our God? You are most high, excellent, most powerful, omnipotent, supremely merciful and supremely just, most hidden yet intimately present, infinitely beautiful and infinitely strong, steadfast yet elusive, unchanging yourself though you control the change in all things, never new, never old, renewing all things yet wearing down the proud though they know it not; ever active, ever at rest, gathering while knowing no need, supporting and filling and guarding, creating and nurturing and perfecting, seeking although you lack nothing. You love without frenzy, you are jealous yet secure, you regret without sadness, you grow angry yet remain tranquil, you alter your works but never your plan; you take back what you find although you never lost it; you are never in need yet you rejoice in your gains, never avaricious yet you demand profits. You allow us to pay you more than you demand, and so you become our debtor, yet which of us possesses anything that does not already belong to you? You owe us nothing, yet you pay your debts; you write off our debts to you, yet you lose nothing thereby.<br><br> After saying all that, what have we said, my God, my life, my holy sweetness? What does anyone who speaks of you really say? Yet woe betide those who fail to speak, while the chatterboxes go on saying nothing.<br><br> 5, 5. Who will grant me to find peace in you? Who will grant me this grace, that you would come into my heart and inebriate it, enabling me to forget the evils that beset me and embrace you, my only good? What are you to me? Have mercy on me, so that I may tell. What indeed am I to you, that you should command me to love you, and grow angry with me if I do not, and threaten me with enormous woes? Is not the failure to love you woe enough in itself? Alas for me! Through your own merciful dealings with me, O Lord my God, tell me what you are to me. Say to my soul, I am your salvation. Say it so that I can hear it. My heart is listening, Lord; open the ears of my heart and say to my soul, I am your salvation. Let me run toward this voice and seize hold of you. Do not hide your face from me: let me die so that I may see it, for not to see it would be death to me indeed.<br><br> 6. The house of my soul is too small for you to enter: make it more spacious by your coming. It lies in ruins: rebuild it. Some things are to be found there which will offend your gaze; I confess this to be so and know it well. But who will clean my house? To whom but yourself can I cry, Cleanse me of my hidden sins, O Lord, and for those incurred through others pardon your servant? I believe, and so I will speak You know everything, Lord. Have I not laid my own transgressions bare before you to my own condemnation, my God, and have you not forgiven the wickedness of my heart ? I do not argue my case against you, for you are truth itself; nor do I wish to deceive myself, lest my iniquity be caught in its own lies. No, I do not argue the case with you, because if you, Lord, keep the score of our iniquities, then who, Lord, can bear it?<br><br> Infancy<br><br> 6, 7. Yet allow me to speak, though I am but dust and ashes, allow me to speak in your merciful presence, for it is to your mercy that I address myself, not to some man who would mock me. Perhaps you too are laughing at me, but still you will turn mercifully toward me, for what is it that I am trying to say, Lord, except that I do not know whence I came into this life that is but a dying, or rather, this dying state that leads to life? I do not know where I came from. But this I know, that I was welcomed by the tender care your mercy provided for me, for so I have been told by the parents who gave me life according to the flesh, those parents through whose begetting and bearing you formed me within time, although I do not remember it myself. The comforts of human milk were waiting for me, but my mother and my nurses did not fill their own breasts; rather you gave me an infant's nourishment through them in accordance with your plan, from the riches deeply hidden in creation. You restrained me from craving more than you provided, and inspired in those who nurtured me the will to give me what you were giving them, for their love for me was patterned on your law, and so they wanted to pass on to me the overflowing gift they received from you. It was a bounty for them, and a bounty for me from them; or, rather, not from them but only through them, for in truth all good things are from you, O God. Everything I need for health and salvation flows from my God. This I learned later as you cried the truth aloud to me through all you give me, both within and without. At that time I knew only how to suck and be deliciously comforted, and how to cry when anything hurt my body, but no more.<br><br> 8. After this I began to smile, at first only in my sleep and then when I was awake. So I have been told, and I believe it on the strength of what we see other babies doing, for I do not remember doing it myself. Little by little I began to notice where I was, and I would try to make my wishes known to those who might satisfy them; but I was frustrated in this, because my desires were inside me, while other people were outside and could by no effort of understanding enter my mind. So I tossed about and screamed, sending signals meant to indicate what I wanted, those few signs that were the best I could manage, though they did not really express my desires. Often I did not get my way, either because people did not understand or because what I demanded might have harmed me, and then I would throw a tantrum because my elders were not subject to me, nor free people willing to be my slaves; so I would take revenge on them by bursting into tears. I have learned that babies behave like this from those I have been able to watch, and they without knowing it have taught me more surely what I was like myself than did my nurses who knew me well.<br><br> 9. My infancy has been so long dead now, whereas I am alive. But you, O Lord, are ever living and in you nothing dies, for you exist before the dawn of the ages, before anything that can be called "before"; you are God and Lord of everything that you have created. In you stand firm the causes of all unstable things; in you the unchangeable origins of all changeable things abide; in you live the eternal ideas of all irrational and transient creatures. Tell me, I beg you, tell your miserable suppliant, O merciful God, whether my infancy was itself the sequel to some earlier age, now dead and gone. Was there nothing before it, except the life I lived in my mother's womb? Some information about that has been given me, and I have myself seen pregnant women. But then, my God, my sweetness, what came before that? Was I somewhere else? Was I even someone? I have nobody to tell me: neither father nor mother could enlighten me, nor the experience of others, nor any memory of my own. Are you laughing at me for asking you these questions, and are you perhaps commanding me to praise you and confess to you simply about what I do know?<br><br> 10. Confess to you I will, Lord of heaven and earth, and praise you for my earliest days and my infancy, which I do not remember. You allow a person to infer by observing others what his own beginnings were like; we can learn much about ourselves even from the reports of womenfolk. Already I had existence and life, and as my unspeaking stage drew to a close I began to look for signs whereby I might communicate my ideas to others. Where could a living creature like this have come from, if not from you, Lord? Are any of us skillful enough to fashion ourselves? Could there be some channel hollowed out from some other source through which existence and life might flow to us, apart from yourself, Lord, who create us? Could we derive existence and life from anywhere other than you, in whom to be and to live are not two different realities, since supreme being and supreme life are one and the same? You are supreme and you do not change, and in you there is no "today" that passes. Yet in you our "today"does pass, inasmuch as all things exist in you, and would have no means even of passing away if you did not contain them. Because your years do not fail, your years are one "Today." How many of our days and our ancestors' days have come and gone in this "Today" of yours, have received from it their manner of being and have existed after their fashion, and how many others will likewise receive theirs, and exist in their own way? Yet you are the self-same: all our tomorrows and beyond, all our yesterdays and further back, you will make in your Today, you have made in your Today.<br><br> What does it matter to me, if someone does not understand this? Let such a person rejoice even to ask the question, "What does this mean?" Yes, let him rejoice in that, and choose to find by not finding rather than by finding fail to find you.</p><h2>Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction</h2><p>Bondspeople who fled from slavery during and after the Civil War did not expect that their flight toward freedom would lead to sickness, disease, suffering, and death. But the war produced the largest biological crisis of the nineteenth century, and as historian Jim Downs reveals in this groundbreaking volume, it had deadly consequences for hundreds of thousands of freed people.<br><br>In <em>Sick from Freedom</em>, Downs recovers the untold story of one of the bitterest ironies in American history--that the emancipation of the slaves, seen as one of the great turning points in U.S. history, had devastating consequences for innumerable freed people. Drawing on massive new research into the records of the Medical Division of the Freedmen's Bureau-a nascent national health system that cared for more than one million freed slaves-he shows how the collapse of the plantation economy released a plague of lethal diseases. With emancipation, African Americans seized the chance to move, migrating as never before. But in their journey to freedom, they also encountered yellow fever, smallpox, cholera, dysentery, malnutrition, and exposure. To address this crisis, the Medical Division hired more than 120 physicians, establishing some forty underfinanced and understaffed hospitals scattered throughout the South, largely in response to medical emergencies. Downs shows that the goal of the Medical Division was to promote a healthy workforce, an aim which often excluded a wide range of freedpeople, including women, the elderly, the physically disabled, and children. Downs concludes by tracing how the Reconstruction policy was then implemented in the American West, where it was disastrously applied to Native Americans. <br><br>The widespread medical calamity sparked by emancipation is an overlooked episode of the Civil War and its aftermath, poignantly revealed in <em>Sick from Freedom</em>.<em> </em><br></p><p><br><strong>Jim Downs </strong>is Associate Professor of History and American Studies at Connecticut College.

It turned out that Switchblade&#x2019;s Japanese blood was more important to him than his American upbringing. </p><p>But after a last-ditch swing from Jack and a desperate struggle above the abyss, Jack had jammed the Pillar in place just as the two of them had dropped from the upside-down peak and commenced their fall into the bottomless darkness. </p><p>The rocky walls of the abyss rushed past Jack in a blur of speed. He fell with Switchblade in a tumbling ungainly way, their limbs still awkwardly entwined. </p><p>As they plummeted, Switchblade punched and scratched and lashed out at Jack, before grabbing his shirt and glaring at him with baleful eyes, screaming above the wind, &#x201c;<i>You!</i> You did this! At least I know you&#x2019;ll die with me!&#x201d; </p><p>Jack parried away the crazed Marine&#x2019;s blows as they fell. </p><p>&#x201c;No, I won&#x2019;t . . .&#x201d; he said grimly as he suddenly kicked Switchblade square in the chest, pushing himself away from the suicidal Marine&#x2014;at the same time, grabbing something from a holster on Switchblade&#x2019;s back, something that every Force Recon Marine carried. </p><p>His Maghook. </p><p>Switchblade saw the device in Jack&#x2019;s hands, and his eyes widened in horror. He tried to grab it, but now Jack was out of his reach. </p><p>&#x201c;No! <i>No!!</i>&#x201d; </p><p>Still falling, Jack pivoted in the air, turning his back on Switchblade to face the wall of the abyss. </p><p>He fired the Maghook. </p><p><i>Whump!</i> </p><p>The high-tech grappling hook flew out from its gunlike launcher, its metal claws snapping outward as it did so, its 150-foot-long reinforced-nylon cable wobbling like a tail behind it. </p><p>The grappling hook&#x2019;s claws hit the wall of the abyss, scraped against it, searching for a purchase before&#x2014;<i>whack!</i>&#x2014;they found an uneven section of rock and caught&#x2014;and instantly Jack&#x2019;s cable went taut&#x2014;and his fall was abruptly and violently arrested, and it took all his might to keep a grip on the Maghook&#x2019;s launcher. </p><p>But hold on he did, and as he swung in toward the vertical wall of the abyss, the last thing he saw behind him was the shocked, furious, powerless, horrified, and <i>beaten</i> look on Switchblade&#x2019;s face as he fell into black nothingness, his evil mission a failure&#x2014;a failure that was multiplied a hundredfold by the realization that Jack West had got the better of him with one of his own weapons and that he was now going to die alone. </p><p>Jack swung into the wall of the abyss with a colossal thump that almost dislocated his left shoulder. </p><p>Silence. </p><p>For a moment, Jack hung there from the cable of Switchblade&#x2019;s Maghook, dangling from the rocky vertical wall of the great abyss, high above the center of the world and at least a thousand feet below the upside-down bronze pyramid of the Vertex. Despite its immense size, it now looked positively tiny. </p><p>Closing his eyes, Jack exhaled the biggest sigh of relief of his life. </p><p>&#x201c;What the <i>hell</i> were you thinking, Jack?&#x201d; he whispered to himself, catching his breath, letting the adrenaline rush subside. </p><p>A flutter of feathers made him spin, and suddenly a small brown peregrine falcon alighted on his shoulder. </p><p>Horus. </p><p>His faithful bird pecked affectionately at his ear. </p><p>Jack smiled wearily but genuinely. &#x201c;Thanks, bird. I&#x2019;m glad I survived, too.&#x201d; </p><p>Distant shouts from up in the Vertex made him look up&#x2014;Wolf&#x2019;s people must have noticed that the Pillar had been set in place and were now sending men to get it. </p><p>Jack sighed. He could never hope to climb back up in time to catch them, let alone stop them. He might have saved the world and their lives <i>and</i> killed the traitor in their midst, but now the bad guys were going to get the booty: the Second Pillar&#x2019;s reward, the mysterious concept known only as <i>heat</i>. </p><p>But there was nothing Jack could do about that now. </p><p>He turned to Horus. &#x201c;You coming?&#x201d; </p><p>And with that, he gazed up at the pyramid high above him and after a deep breath, reeled in the Maghook, grabbed a handhold on the rough surface of the abyss&#x2019;s wall, and began the long climb upward. </p><p>� 2010 Karanadon entertainment Pty, Ltd.</p></p><h2>Hekate: Keys to the Crossroads: A collection of personal essays, invocations, rituals, recipes and artwork from modern Witches, Priestesses and ...

Very interesting with a lot of personal experiences.</strong></p><p>I really like this book- some of the reviews I read about it stated the spelling was really bad, but this book is from England- I lived there &amp; learned a lot of words are spelled differently(which I probably wouldn't have known if I wasn't there) I like reading about people's personal experiences, and with so many in one book it's nice to read all of the different stories. - Tara W, Amazon reviewer</p><p> </p><p><strong>Great read. Very informative</strong></p><p>I like the varying details from different people regarding Hecate and special ceremonies. I really like this book and very happy I purchased it. - Sandra Waine, Amazon reviewer</p><p> </p><p><strong>Accurate, personal, and a must-read</strong></p><p>To be honest, I almost passed this book by because of its home-spun appearance. I was afraid that it was just another pseudo-spiritual, misinformed New Age compiliation by people who don't really know the subject. I went ahead and bought it anyway, and I am so glad that I did! Do not let the apparent simplicty of this book fool you. Although written in everyday language, the content is among the best I've seen on the subject of Hekate. It is well-researched, and avoids (and actually debunks, much to my delight) many of the most common misconceptions of this amazing deity that even many pagans are guilty of perpetuating.</p><p>My only peeve is with Part II, the personal essay portion of the book. I loved hearing the multiplicty of voices and perspectives, but it's obvious that the essays were published exactly as they were submitted; there are numerous typos, grammatical errors and other issues that could easily have been remedied with even a simple editing job. These errors detract from what are otherwise very engaging pieces.</p><p>This charming and informative book should be essential reading for anyone interested in Hekate. As a scholar of religion with a personal appreciation of Hekate, I've already done much research on Her and therefore did not really learn anything "new" in Part I ("Hekate's History"), but the rest of the book definitely gave me new things to ponder. It was spiritually uplifting and thought-provoking...which is, I suppose, the point. Although academically sound, this is much more than a book for academics. It is a book for practitioners, and anyone interested in developing a relationship with Hekate would be wise to read it. - Lynne M. Meyer, Amazon reviewer</p></p><h2>Baptist Foundations: Church Government for an Anti-Institutional Age</h2><p>Ours is an anti-polity age, perhaps more than any other time in the history of the church. Yet polity remains as important now as it was in the New Testament.<br> &nbsp;<br> What then is a right or biblical polity? The contributors to this volume make an exegetical and theological case for a Baptist polity.

Now, in an updated edition with fifty pages of new content, Rachel Simon reflects on changes in her life, Beth's life, and the lives of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The highlight is Beth's update, which is in her own words. A new Reader's Guide is also included. Join these two unforgettable sisters on their journey, this time in an even deeper and richer way.<br><br> Rachel Simon's sister Beth is a spirited woman who lives intensely and often joyfully. Beth, who has an intellectual disability, spends her days riding the buses in her unnamed Pennsylvania city. The drivers, a lively group, are her mentors; her fellow passengers are her community. One day, Beth asks Rachel to accompany her on the buses for an entire year. This wise, funny, deeply affecting true story is the chronicle of that remarkable time. Rachel, a writer and college teacher whose hyperbusy life camouflaged her emotional isolation, had much to learn in her sister's extraordinary world. Full of life lessons from which any reader will profit, <i>Riding the Bus with My Sister</i> is "a heartwarming, life-affirming journey through both the present and the past...[that] might just change your life" (<em>Boston Herald</em>).<br><br>Elegantly woven throughout the odyssey are riveting memories of terrifying maternal abandonment, fierce sisterly loyalty, and astonishing forgiveness. Rachel Simon brings to light the almost invisible world of adults with developmental disabilities, finds unlikely heroes in everyday life, and, without sentimentality, portrays Beth as the endearing, feisty, independent person she is. This heartwarming memoir about the unbreakable bond between two very different sisters takes the reader on an inspirational journey at once unique and universal. <br><br><i>Riding the Bus with My Sister</i> was made into a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie starring Rosie O'Donnell and Andie McDowell, and directed by Anjelica Huston.</p><p>Rachel Simon is an award-winning author and nationally known public speaker. She is best known for her critically acclaimed, bestselling memoir <em>Riding the Bus with My Sister</em>, which was adapted for a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie of the same name. The book has garnered numerous awards, and is a frequent and much beloved selection of many book clubs, school reading programs, and city-wide reads throughout the country. Simon is also the author of the bestselling novel <em>The Story of Beautiful Girl</em>.January<br><br>The Journey<br><br>"Wake up," my sister Beth says. "We won"t make the first bus."<br> At six a.m. on this winter morning, moonlight still bathes <br>her apartment. She"s already dressed: grape-juice-colored T-shirt and <br>pistachio shorts, with a purple Winnie-the-Pooh backpack slung over <br>her shoulder. I struggle awake and into my clothes: black sweater, <br>black leggings. Beth and I, both in our late thirties, were born <br>eleven months apart, but we are different in more than age. She owns <br>a wardrobe of blazingly bright colors and can leap out of bed before <br>dawn. She is also a woman with mental retardation.<br> I"ve come here to give Beth her holiday present: I"ve come to <br>ride the buses.<br> For six years, she has lived on her own. In her subsidized <br>apartment, a few blocks off the main avenue of a gritty, medium-sized <br>Pennsylvania city, each of her days could easily resemble the next &#x2014; <br>she has a lot of time, having been laid off from her job busing <br>tables at a fast food restaurant. She has enough money to live on, as <br>a recipient of government assistance for people with disabilities.<br> But Beth also has something else: ingenuity.<br> This trait isn"t generally ascribed to people who live on the <br>periphery of society"s vision. Like indigent seniors, people with <br>untreated mental illness, and the homeless, Beth is someone many <br>people in the mainstream don"t think much about, or even see.<br> Six months after she moved to her fifth-floor apartment, she <br>realized that she was lonely, and had consumed all the episodes of <br>The Price Is Right and All My Children that she could tolerate. So <br>one day she decided to ride the buses. Not just to ride them the way <br>most of us do, and which her aides had trained her to do a few years <br>before. She wasn"t interested in something as ordinary as getting <br>from one location to another. She wanted to ride them her way.<br> It was, Beth recalls, October 18, 1993, when, for reasons she <br>cannot remember, she first picked her monthly bus pass off her coffee <br>table. Then she pressed the first-floor button in her high-rise <br>elevator, walked through the vestibule to the street, hailed a bus on <br>the corner, climbed the steps toward the driver, settled into a seat, <br>and looped through the city from dawn to dusk, trying out one run <br>after another, bus to bus to bus. Soon she was riding a dozen a day, <br>some for five minutes, others for hours, befriending drivers and <br>passengers as she wound through the narrow streets of the city and <br>its wreath of rolling hills. Within weeks she could navigate anywhere <br>within a ten-mile radius, and, by studying the shifting <br>constellations of characters and the schedules posted weekly in the <br>bus terminal, she could calculate who would be at precisely which <br>intersection at any moment of any day. She staked out friendships all <br>over the city, weaving her own traveling community.<br> Beth"s case manager had not suggested this, nor had Regis and <br>Kathie Lee, nor even Beth"s boyfriend. This idea was hers alone.<br> We hurry down Main Street, the moon setting behind the <br>buildings. My guide, whose fuzzy brown hair is still wet from her <br>morning bath, points out the identifying numbers on bus shelters, the <br>scowls of grouchy drivers. She wears no watch, telling time instead <br>by the buses.<br> We dart into the downtown McDonald"s, already, at six-thirty <br>a.m., filled with early risers: clusters of the elderly playing <br>cards, solitary office workers bent over newspapers. Beth orders <br>coffee, though she doesn"t drink coffee, palming out the eighty-four <br>cents before the server asks.<br> Then we bolt into the dawn, making a beeline for a bus <br>shelter. Head craned down the street, Beth giggles as she once did <br>when I took her to a Donny Osmond concert: thrilled, in her element. <br>She clutches her yellow radio and a tangle of key chains &#x2014; twenty-<br>nine, by her count &#x2014; Cookie Monster, smiley faces, peace signs, which <br>hold a total of two keys. She does a drumbeat on her laminated bus <br>pass, stickered 000001. Every month she renews it, arriving first in <br>line at the sales window. That sticker is her private coat of arms, <br>proof that she"s queen of these routes.<br> Our first bus draws up to the curb. The driver, Claude, <br>throws open his door as if welcoming us to his house. Beth clomps <br>aboard, arm thrust forward with the coffee. He takes the steaming <br>plastic cup, then thumbs four quarters into her hand. "Our <br>agreement," he explains to me.<br> Then she spins toward "her" seat &#x2014; the premier spot on the <br>front sideways bench, catty-corner from his, so she"ll be as close to <br>him as possible. I sit beside her; as a suburbanite who relies on my <br>car and the occasional commuter train, it is my first time on a city <br>transit bus in years. We pull out, past working-class row houses, a <br>Christian lawn ornament store, a farmers" market, an abandoned candy <br>factory, Asian grocers. Short hair, just beginning to gray, fans out <br>from underneath Claude"s driver"s cap. Beth announces that he"s forty-<br>two, with a birthday coming soon. He laughs as she offers the exact <br>date and then explains how he likes to spend his birthdays. "She <br>remembers everything," he says.<br> He asks if she"ll change into her flip-flops should this <br>chilly day become as balmy as the forecast predicts. "If iz over <br>forty," she replies, "you know I will." He tells me they "jam" with <br>her radio when the bus is empty. "Real loud," she adds. They recall <br>some trouble with a rider months ago. "She was mean," Beth says <br>indignantly. Claude agrees, and recounts the altercation, in which a <br>passenger vehemently challenged his knowledge of upcoming stops, and <br>which culminated, after the malcontent had finally exited, in <br>Claude"s relief that Beth was sharing the ride &#x2014; he had someone who <br>could sigh along with him.<br> Moments later, we pass Beth"s boyfriend on his bicycle. Also <br>an adult with mental retardation, Jesse has paused at a crosswalk, <br>his maple brown face pointing straight ahead, his blind left eye <br>looking milky in the light, sun glinting off the helmet Beth long ago <br>convinced him to wear. The decade they"ve been together is more than <br>a fourth of their lives. Claude picks up his intercom mike and calls <br>out, "Hello, Jesse!" Jesse looks over. We twist around in our seats, <br>and his mustached face brightens as we wave.<br> All day, when we mount Jacob"s bus, Estella"s, Rodolpho"s, <br>one driver after another greets Beth heartily. They tell me she helps <br>out: reminds them where to turn on runs they haven"t driven for a <br>while, teaches them the Top Ten songs on the radio, keeps them <br>abreast of schedule and personnel changes, and visits them in the <br>hospital when they"re sick. She assists her fellow passengers as <br>well, answering questions about how to reach their destinations, <br>sharing their consternation when the bus halts for double-parked <br>delivery trucks, carrying their third bag of groceries to the curb.<br> In return, many riders smile hello to her and ask how she"s <br>doing; many drivers are hospitable, even affectionate. Jacob asks if <br>she has gotten a new winter coat and if the homeless woman who <br>clashed with her last month has bothered her again. Jack slips her <br>money for soda. Bert squawks out songs, making her laugh at his <br>jaggedy tunes.<br> Not everyone is nice. Some drivers, I learn, call her "The <br>Pest." When they see Beth at a stop ahead, they cruise right by, gaze <br>glued to the road. Some riders warn them, crying out, "Keep going!" <br>when they spy her waiting on the curb, and, if she climbs on, they <br>bleat in her face, "Shut up! Go home!"<br> "I don"t care," she says and shrugs. When we were growing up, <br>I saw a twinge of anguish on her face whenever kids called her <br>poisonous names, and sometimes the hurt took hours to fade. Now I see <br>that, surrounded by friends, she regains her composure quickly.<br> That"s not all that has changed, I discover. Beth, once a <br>willful child who, like many willful children, felt most secure at <br>home, has grown into an extravagantly social and nonconforming adult, <br>one who creates camaraderie out of bus timetables, refuses to trouble <br>herself when people look askance at her &#x2014; and, in a buoyant <br>refutation of the notion that mental retardation equals sluggishness, <br>zips about jauntily to her own inner beat. My sister (my sister! I <br>boast to myself) maneuvers through the world with the confidence of a <br>museum curator walking approvingly through her galleries, and, far <br>from bemoaning her otherness, she exults in it.<br> That afternoon, as I step to the curb and wave goodbye to her <br>through the bus window, I am pierced by a sudden memory, minted only <br>this morning. She was sailing her short, stout body across the street <br>toward McDonald"s, and I was scrambling behind. In the predawn <br>moonlight, as she chattered on about our labyrinthine itinerary, well <br>aware that there are few if any other people in this world devoted to <br>a calling of bell cords and exhaust fumes, she spontaneously threw <br>back her head and trumpeted, "I"m diffrent! I"m diffrent!" as if she <br>were hurling a challenge with all her might beyond the limits of the <br>sky.<br><br>In the course of my life, cars and trains and jets have whisked me to <br>wherever I wanted to go, and I was going places, I thought; I was <br>racing my way to becoming a Somebody. A Somebody who would live a Big <br>Life. What that meant exactly, I wasn"t sure. I just knew that I <br>longed to escape the restrictions of what I saw as a small life: <br>friends and a family and a safe, unobjectionable job that would pay <br>me a passably adequate income. Although this package encompassed just <br>the kind of existence many people I knew were utterly content with, I <br>wanted something more.<br> Then, in the winter of my thirty-ninth year, I boarded a bus <br>with my sister and discovered that I wanted broader and deeper <br>rewards than those I would find in the Big Life.<br> At the time, I thought I had my life under control. In <br>addition to having published several books, I was teaching college as <br>well as holding classes for private students, writing free-lance <br>commentary for the Philadelphia Inquirer, and hosting events at a <br>bookstore. I adored everything I did, which is more than many of my <br>acquaintances could say.<br> But, though I wouldn"t confess it to myself, I worked all the <br>time. Seven days a week, from the minute I threw off the covers at <br>seven a.m. until I disintegrated back inside them at one a.m., I <br>leapt like a hare through my schedule: Write article ? Grade student <br>papers ? Interview newspaper subject ? Book author for store signing <br>? Teach private class ? Take notes for next novel ? Eat ? Crash.<br> My life, I told myself, bore little resemblance to the lives <br>of workers in corporate America. After all, I made my own schedule <br>and wore comfy leggings and sweaters at my desk, saving the A-line <br>skirts and blazers and lipstick until I drove out to class or the <br>bookstore. To unwind, I took vigorous walks whenever I pleased, <br>keeping my five-foot build lean and fit. But who was I kidding? I was <br>like most of my peers: hyperbusy, hypercritical, hyperventilating.<br> As a result, I bricked in all the spaces in my week when I <br>might have seen friends, and so it followed that I lost many of them. <br>I lost my opportunity to indulge in almost all leisure activities as <br>well: no movies or plays, and, though I continued to purchase new <br>novels and routinely carted home any intriguing texts I found on <br>the "Take Me" shelf at school, dust settled on the pages like snow, <br>as I had time to read few books beyond those I needed for my work. <br>But perhaps the greatest forfeit was love. I"d had a few awkward <br>dinner dates in the four years since my longtime live-in romance had <br>come to a mutually tearful and reluctant end, and even those strained <br>opportunities had petered out. Alone in my apartment in the <br>Philadelphia suburbs, dining at my desk most nights, I occasionally <br>browsed the personal ads. But then I"d open my datebook, remember <br>that I had no time to meet for coffee, and turn back to my work.<br> This had not always been me. Until I found myself single, my <br>evenings had been filled with dinner parties and art openings and <br>reading groups and two-hour phone calls with my girlfriends. That is, <br>when my nights weren"t already occupied by relaxed conversations on <br>the sofa with my boyfriend, Sam, where we"d go on about books and <br>politics and the seductive lure of the Big Life, our exchanges <br>interrupted only when he"d get up to flip through his voluminous <br>record collection, then set the needle on recordings by, maybe, Miles <br>Davis, or the English folk musician Nick Drake. I don"t know when <br>things stopped working for us; I just know that when he asked me to <br>marry him I could not bring myself to make the commitment. Finally, <br>in a blur of grief and regret, convinced I should let him move on <br>with his life, I left. I took only my necessities &#x2014; computer, desk, <br>and clothes &#x2014; and camped out in one cheap rented room after another <br>while I tried to make sense of my life, and of what seemed to be a <br>stony heart. It didn"t help that for years I had subsisted on Sam"s <br>architect"s salary, plus my writing jobs, and now, in one of those <br>unnerving coincidences of fate, they suddenly dried up. Those first <br>few months on my own, I was so lonely and broke that my stomach would <br>seize up during the night and I"d wake on my air mattress, clinging <br>to a pillow, and lie awake until morning. During the day, catching my <br>reflection in my computer screen and seeing only failure, I"d feel my <br>face tighten with terror.<br> Finally, I accepted a job at a bookstore, and, as luck would <br>have it, started publishing at the Philadelphia Inquirer. Then, <br>marveling at the dollar signs sprouting in my check register and <br>discovering that with each newspaper column and wave of bookstore <br>applause I felt myself on my way to the Big Life, I accepted <br>positions teaching as well. I rented an apartment and purchased a <br>bona fide bed, but did not acquire a stereo or TV, as I hadn"t missed <br>either enough to replace it. And I worked. I worked until I was so <br>exhausted I fell back asleep easily when I woke during the night. I <br>worked until I forgot I was lonely, until I could not conceive of any <br>other existence.<br> I hadn"t seen Beth in a couple of years. We stayed in touch <br>through letters; once a week I"d scratch out a card, and in return <br>she"d cascade fifteen back. Her letters consisted of two or three <br>multicapitalized sentences sprawling down the page, sprinkled with <br>periods, which she"d then fold into envelopes flamboyantly tattooed <br>with stickers and addressed in fall-off-the-paper print. I relished <br>finding these treats populating my mailbox, whole colonies arriving <br>in a single day. In Magic Marker scrawl, they gossiped about our <br>younger brother (I aM Glad that.Max got a new rED car. when he Came <br>with his kids. good) and older sister (Laura sentMe. a gift Thing for <br>WAlmart), educated me about the latest Top Ten (Do you. like In Sinks <br>I want you back. I do), and revised my knowledge of Jesse"s athletic <br>achievements (Jesse did do that big race. WoW). Best of all, they <br>climaxed in a spunky declaration that defied the world"s clich� of <br>her as an uncomplicated half-wit, signed as they were, "Cool Beth."<br> But when I phoned...</p><h2>National Security Cinema: The Shocking New Evidence of Government Control in Hollywood</h2><p>This is a book about secrecy, militarism, manipulation, and censorship at the heart of the world&#x2019;s leading democracy&#x2014;and about those who try to fight them. Using thousands of pages of documents acquired through the Freedom of Information Act <i>National Security Cinema</i> exclusively reveals that the national security state&#x2014;led by the CIA and Pentagon&#x2014;has worked on more than eight-hundred Hollywood films and over a thousand network television shows. The latest scholarship has underestimated the size of this operation, in part because the government has gone to considerable lengths to prevent data emerging, especially in the 21st Century, as the practice of government-Hollywood cooperation has escalated and become more aggressive. <i>National Security Cinema</i> reveals for the first time specific script changes made by the government for political reasons on dozens of blockbusting films and franchises like Transformers, Avatar, Meet the Parents, and The Terminator. These forces have suppressed important narratives about: CIA drug trafficking; illegal arms sales; military creation of bio-weapons; the interaction of private armies and oil companies; government treatment of minorities; torture; coups; assassinations, and the failure to prevent 9/11.</p><p>Dr. Matthew Alford is a Teaching Fellow at the University of Bath in England.

Hailed as a landmark work when it was first published in 1994, <em>Bystander</em> is widely regarded by street photographers as the "bible" of street photography. <br><br>It covers an incredible array of talent, from the unknowns of the late 19th century to the acknowledged masters of the 20th, such as Atget, Stieglitz, Strand, Cartier-Bresson, Brassai, Kertesz, Frank, Arbus, Winogrand, and Levitt to name just a few. <br><br>In this new and fully revised edition, the story of street photography is brought up to date with a re-evaluation of some historical material, the inclusion of more contemporary photographers, and a discussion of the ongoing rise of digital photography.</p><p>Joel Meyerowitz started making spontaneous color photographs on the streets of New York in 1962 with friends such as Tony Ray-Jones and Garry Winogrand. He has since become known as one of the most important street photographers of his generation. Instrumental in changing attitudes towards color photography in the 1970s, he is known as a pioneer, an important innovator, and a highly influential teacher.<br><br>Formerly a Curator of Photography at the Art Institute of Chicago and Director of the California Museum of Photography at the University of California, Riverside, Colin Westerbeck has also taught the history of photography at the University of Southern California and, currently, UCLA. He is internationally acknowledged as the foremost expert on street photography.This substantial book embraces the history of street photography as social and cultural document. Generously illustrated with black-and-white photographs as well as a small selection of color images, the book touches upon the work of acknowledged masters such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Andre Kertesz, Paul Strand, Bill Brandt, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, and many others. Farm Security Administration photographers, including Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange, also receive their due along with contemporary American photographers Weegee (Arthur Fellig), Gary Winogrand, Lee Friedlander, Diane Arbus, and Helen Levitt-to name just a few. This ambitious effort is perhaps most successful in bringing together the work of these classic photographers in a thoughtful, coherent study of this fascinating genre of photography. Westerbeck is associate curator of at the Art Institute of Chicago and Meyerowitz is a photographer (Bay/Sky, LJ 12/93).

After arriving, Jason's mistaken for his rich cousin Keith Summerland, who's ditched his bride-to-be to run off with the wife of a vampire Master, giving Anita a case to solve between wild orgies with wereanimals. Hamilton chronicles Anita's escapades with a growing air of ennui, which longtime readers can't help sharing as sex increasingly takes the place of plot and character development. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We see George the adventurous boy, tromping through the woods with his dog and his hunting rifle; George the courageous military leader fighting alongside his men; George the cunning military strategist, outfoxing the British and forcing their surrender at Yorktown; George the brilliant statesman presiding over the Constitutional Convention; and George the President, wisely protecting our country from enemies foreign and domestic so it could grow strong. But through it all, we see George as happiest living as an experimental farmer at Mount Vernon with his wife, Martha. He could have been Emperor of America, but he chose to spend his last years "looking after things that needed doing" at home.<br><br>National Geographic supports K-12 educators with ELA Common Core Resources.<br>Visit&nbsp;www.natgeoed.org/commoncore&nbsp;for more information.</p><p>Cheryl Harness lives near Independence, MO.

It describes Washington's life primarily through his role in the American Revolution and his presidency, but it also gives a clear description of his active youth. Details such as his enjoyment of adventure and dancing, his longing to be an officer in the British army, and his attempts to avoid his bossy mother all help to dispel the image of an austere figure best known through statuary and formal portraits. Other facts tell a great deal about his bravery in the Revolution and his wisdom in his role as the nation's first leader. The full and double-page mixed-media illustrations are beautifully executed, though occasionally busy, and enhance the attractiveness of the volume. Hand-lettered notes, labels, captions, and maps are incorporated into the art and add to the text.

The words in this book come from the heart--mine and the hearts of others. I pray that you will find within them a spark that will ignite the flame of hope and the passion for healing that lies within us all."<br><br>Naomi Levy was a spirited fifteen-year-old when her father was murdered in a senseless holdup that destroyed not only his life but her trust in a loving God. Healing took a long time, yet from her struggles with grief, anger, and depression, she forged the wisdom that made her, at twenty-six, a beloved rabbi--and now makes her book a miracle of honesty, recovery, and compassion.<br><br>Where do we find the strength to meet tragedy? Can we rekindle hope? Innocence? Faith? The answers, illustrated with many moving, true stories drawn from Rabbi Levy's experience and the lives of her congregants, provide sanity, peace, and a safe harbor where we can heal and grow. Remember: "Death is a great tragedy. But to die while we are still living, that is the greatest tragedy of all."</p><p>"Then what good is God?" a rape victim asked Rabbi Naomi Levy after Levy said she didn't think preventing tragedies was in God's hands. Levy realizes that the question after a personal tragedy should not be, "Why did this happen?" but rather, "How can I go on?" <i>To Begin Again</i> is a book of comfort and faith to lead us through tragic times. Her advice is wise, gentle, and compassionate, dotted with stories of people Levy knows who have endured terrible pain--and healed. She teaches us to get comfort from asking others for help, letting ourselves cry, seeking a community of faith, studying something new, and keeping memories alive. She shows us how to rebuild our lives by facing the truth, loving and forgiving ourselves, repairing relationships with loved ones, teaching our hearts to remain open, holding onto our faith, and, finally, transforming ourselves.<p> Levy understands emotional agony firsthand: she lost her beloved father to a robber's gun when she was 15. Levy's message in this beautiful, moving book is, "Each of us possesses the power to overcome the unthinkable and be reborn, to live life not as survivors but as partakers, rejoicers, participants." <i>--Joan Price</i></p>"For anyone who has ever lost or suffered, Rabbi Levy's words will shine in the dark like a night-light."<br>--Rachel Naomi Remem, M.D., author of <i>Kitchen Table Wisdom: Stories That Heal</i><p>"Her voice is a voice of clarity, comfort &amp; compassion."<br>--Rabbi Harold Kushner, author of <i>When Bad Things Happen to Good People</i></p><p>"A source of great comfort when dealing with the truly big stuff."<br>--Richard Carlson, author of <i>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff...and It's All Small Stuff</i><br></p></p><h2>Dark Rites: A Paranormal Romance Novel (Krewe of Hunters, 22)</h2><p><strong><em>The witches, they are real...</em></strong><br><br>A series of bizarre assaults is mystifying Boston police: an unknown attacker is viciously beating random strangers and leaving a note quoting an old warning about witchcraft.

There is no human activity, no matter how mundane, that cannot be enhanced by this formation in beauty. Such enhanced activity then resonates in harmony with the common good and, through its beauty, draws all people to the Church--and ultimately to the worship of God in the Sacred Liturgy.<br><i> The Way of Beauty</i> will be of profound interest not only to artists, architects, and composers, but also to educators, who can apply its principles in home and classroom for the formation and education of children and students of all ages and at all levels--family, homeschooling, high school, college, and university.</p><p>"Since the good, the true, and the beautiful are a manifestation of the Trinity, it is always a grievous fault to leave beauty out of any discussion of the relationship between faith and reason. This being so, I am thrilled at the way David Clayton illustrates how beauty stands in eternal communion with the good and the true."--<b>JOSEPH PEARCE</b>, Aquinas College<br><br>"In spite of the great proclamation that the sacred liturgy is the font and apex of all we are about as Catholics, fifty years after the Council we still seem far from seeing and living this truth in all its fullness. Drawing upon years of experience as artist and teacher, David Clayton thoroughly unpacks this truth and shows, with an impressive range of examples, how it can and should play out every day in our schools, academic curricula, cultural endeavors, and practice of the fine arts. His treatment of the ways in which architecture, liturgy, and music reflect the mathematical ordering of the cosmos and the hierarchy of created being is illuminating and exciting. <i>The Way of Beauty</i> is a manifesto for the re-integration of the truth laid hold of in intellectual disciplines, the beauty aspired to in art and worship, and the good embodied in morals and manners. Ambitiously integrative yet highly practical, this book ought to be in the hands of every Catholic educator, pastor, and artist."--<b>PETER KWASNIEWSKI</b>, Wyoming Catholic College<br><br>"In <i>The Way of Beauty</i>, David Clayton offers us a mini-liberal arts education. The book is a counter-offensive against a culture that so often seems to have capitulated to a 'will to ugliness.' He shows us the power in beauty not just where we might expect it--in the visual arts and music--but in domains as diverse as math, theology, morality, physics, astronomy, cosmology, and liturgy. But more than that, his study of beauty makes clear the connection between liturgy, culture, and evangelization, and offers a way to reinvigorate our commitment to the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in the twenty-first century. I am grateful for this book and hope many will take its lessons to heart."--<b>JAY W. RICHARDS</b>, Catholic University of America<br><br>"Every pope who has promoted the new evangelization has spoken about how essential 'the way of beauty' is in engaging the modern world with the Gospel. What is it about the experience of beauty that can arrest the heart, crack it open, and stir its deepest longings, leading us on a pilgrimage to God? David Clayton's book provides compelling answers."--<b>CHRISTOPHER WEST</b>, Founder and President of The Cor Project<br><br>"David Clayton has written a wonderful new book that highlights the centrality of beauty and art in education and human formation. He explains the deep relationship between liturgy and culture, while offering practical ways to educate a new generation of artists who can bring about what St. John Paul called a 'new epiphany of beauty.'"--<b>MICHAEL MATHESON MILLER</b>, Acton Institute<b> DAVID CLAYTON</b> is an internationally acclaimed Catholic artist, teacher, and published writer on sacred art, liturgy, and culture.

She had a play that was to be produced at the New York Fringe Festival and a job waiting for her at <i>The</i> <i>New Yorker</i>. Tragically, five days after graduation, Marina died in a car crash.<br> <br>Marina left behind a rich, deeply expansive trove of writing that, like her title essay, captures the hope, uncertainty, and possibility of her generation. Her short story &#x201c;Cold Pastoral&#x201d; was published on NewYorker.com. Her essay &#x201c;Even Artichokes Have Doubts&#x201d; was excerpted in the <i>Financial Times,</i> and her book was the focus of a Nicholas Kristof column in <i>The New York Times</i>. Millions of her contemporaries have responded to her work on social media. <br> <br>As Marina wrote: &#x201c;We can still do anything. We can change our minds.

Moehringer <p><b></b></p><b>About J. R. Moehringer</b><p></p> <p>J. R. Moehringer, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing in 2000, is a former national correspondent for the Los Angeles Times. Author of the bestselling memoir, <i>The Tender Bar,</i> he is also the co-author of <i>Open</i> by Andre Agassi. His most recent publication is <i>Sutton</i>, published in 2012.</p> <br> <p><b></b></p><b>J. R. Moehringer on Marina Keegan</b><p></p> <p>I never met Marina Keegan, but when I learned of her death I felt as if I'd known her well. We belonged to several of the same tribes. We were both Yalies. We were both from the Northeast. Both Irish, both writers. We walked some of the same paths, probably sat in the same chairs. So it was as if I&#x2019;d lost a close cousin, or even a kid sister.</p><p> Then I read her work. In that terrible week, as media outlets posted her essays, as people around the world reposted them, I read every word with a sinking, quickening heart. The first news reports, I felt, had been wrong - this wasn&#x2019;t simply a promising young writer, this was a prodigy, a rare rare talent, still raw, still evolving, but shockingly mature. From the few things she&#x2019;d published in her brief life I could project a remarkable career, a line of words stretching far into the future, words that would have thrilled and enlightened, words that might have changed people&#x2019;s lives. As I grieved for her family, her friends, her boyfriend, I also grieved for the global community of readers who would never know the pleasure and excitement of a brand new book by Marina Keegan.</p> Marina Keegan <p><b></b></p><p></p> <p>All of which made me think there should be, there must be, at least one book with Marina&#x2019;s name on the spine. Publishers aren&#x2019;t eager to take chances these days, but I hoped that one would have the guts, the heart, to make a slim, posthumous collection of Marina&#x2019;s stories and essays and poems. I could actually see the book in my mind, stacked on the front table of a sunlit bookstore, perhaps the Yale bookstore, where I&#x2019;m sure Marina dreamed about her work appearing one day.</p> <p>A year later, it came in the mail, the very book I&#x2019;d seen in my mind, with the only possible title: <i>The Opposite of Loneliness</i>. I studied the striking cover photo and felt a wave of sorrow and joy. Then I sat down and read it and that sorrow-joy feeling became my constant companion over the next several days.</p> <p><b></b></p><p></p> <p>This is a book full of wonders. This is a book full of sentences that any writer, 21 or 101, would be proud to have authored. This is a book that will speak to young readers, because it expresses some of that inexpressible anxiety of starting out, of making life's first momentous choices, of wanting and fearing and needing and hoping and dreading everything at the same time. It will also speak to older readers, because it&#x2019;s an inspiring reminder of youth&#x2019;s brimming energy, its quivering sense of possibility.</p> <p>Young people get a bad rap for thinking they&#x2019;re immortal, and acting accordingly, but Marina dwelled on the end. Hers, civilization&#x2019;s, the sun&#x2019;s. &#x201c;And time, that takes survey of all the world, must have a stop.&#x201d; She must have heard her beloved adviser Harold Bloom expound many times on Hotspur&#x2019;s line, and clearly she took it to heart, personalized it. Savor every half-second, she seemed to be saying, to herself, to her readers, and her meditations on death, once charmingly precocious, now feel breathtakingly premonitory. Describing a group of fifty whales beached near her house on Cape Cod, she laments that their songs don&#x2019;t transmit on land, and thus they can&#x2019;t communicate their final thoughts. &#x201c;I imagined dying slowly next to my mother or a lover, helplessly unable to relay my parting message.&#x201d;</p> <p> Such was her fate. And yet it wasn't, not really. This book is her parting message, exquisitely relayed.</p> <p>And it&#x2019;s not a mournful message. There&#x2019;s so much light and humor here. In the title essay alone I hear glimmers of Lorrie Moore, Ann Beattie, Fran Lebowitz. For example, when Marina worries that other kids are sprinting ahead of her, embarking on fabulous careers while she&#x2019;s still clinging to the cocoon of Yale. &#x201c;Some of us have focused ourselves. Some of us know exactly what we want and are on the path to get it; already going to med school, working at the perfect NGO, doing research. To you I say both congratulations and you suck.&#x201d;</p> <p>My favorite passage might be this gorgeous burst of nostalgia, this prose poem about the bright college years. &#x201c;When the check is paid and you stay at the table. When it&#x2019;s four a.m. and no one goes to bed. That night with the guitar. That night we can&#x2019;t remember. That time we did, we went, we saw, we laughed, we felt. The hats.&#x201d;</p> <p>The hats. That tiny sentence was the first raindrop before the deluge, a tickling hint of all that was to come. How many 21-year-olds are capable of a line so sure-handed, so precisely and comically placed?

Why do working Americans eat the way we do? And what can we do to change it? To find out, McMillan went undercover in three jobs that feed America, living and eating off her wages in each. Reporting from California fields, a Walmart produce aisle outside of Detroit, and the kitchen of a New York City Applebee&#x2019;s, McMillan examines the reality of our country&#x2019;s food industry in this &#x201c;clear and essential&#x201d; (<i>The Boston Globe</i>) work of reportage. Chronicling her own experience and that of the Mexican garlic crews, Midwestern produce managers, and Caribbean line cooks with whom she works, McMillan goes beyond the food on her plate to explore the national priorities that put it there. <br><br>Fearlessly reported and beautifully written, <i>The American Way of Eating </i>goes beyond statistics and culture wars to deliver a book that is fiercely honest, strikingly intelligent, and compulsively readable. In making the simple case that&#x2014;city or country, rich or poor&#x2014;everyone wants good food, McMillan guarantees that talking about dinner will never be the same again.</p><p>The New York Times:<br> &nbsp;<br> Before the Food Arrives on Your Plate, So Much Goes on Behind the Scenes<br> By&nbsp;DWIGHT GARNER<br> Published: February 20, 2012<br> One of the first things to like about Tracie McMillan, the author of "The American Way of Eating," is her forthrightness. She's a blue-collar girl who grew up eating a lot of&nbsp;Tuna Helper&nbsp;and Ortega Taco Dinners because her mother was gravely ill for a decade, and her father, who sold lawn equipment, had little time to cook. About these box meals, she says, "I liked them."<br><br> Expensive food that took time to prepare "wasn't for people like us," she writes. "It was for the people my grandmother described, with equal parts envy and derision, as&nbsp;<i>fancy</i>; my father's word was&nbsp;<i>snob</i>. And I wasn't about to be like that." This is a voice the food world needs.<br><br> Ms. McMillan, like a lot of us, has grown to take an interest in fresh, well-prepared food. She's written forSaveur&nbsp;magazine, a pretty fancy journal, and she knows her way around a kitchen. But her central concern, in her journalism and in this provocative book, is food and class. She stares at America's bounty, noting that so few seem able to share in it fully, and she asks: "What would it take for us all to eat well?"<br> <br>The title of Ms. McMillan's book pays fealty to Jessica Mitford's classic of English nonfiction prose, "The American Way of Death" (1963). Ms. McMillan's sentences don't have Mitford's high style -- they're a pile of leeks, not shallots -- but both books traffic in dark humor. Standing in a Walmart, where she has taken a minimum-wage job, Ms. McMillan observes that its "produce section is nothing less than an expansive life-support system." Most days, when it comes to vegetables, she's putting lipstick on corpses.<br><br> The book Ms. McMillan's most resembles is Barbara Ehrenreich's best seller "Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America" (2001). Like Ms. Ehrenreich, Ms. McMillan goes undercover amid this country's working poor. She takes jobs picking grapes, peaches and garlic in California; stocking produce in a Walmart in Detroit; and working in a busy Applebee's in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn. She tries, and often fails, to live on only the money she earns.<br><br> The news Ms. McMillan brings about life on the front lines is mostly grim. In the California fields, where she is the only gringa, she makes far less than minimum wage, sometimes as little as $26 for nine hours of back-breaking work. She lives in cockroach-filled houses, all she can afford, with more than a dozen other people. She delivers a brutal takedown of corporations that, in her view, pretend on their sunny Web sites to treat workers well but in practice use labor contractors that often cheat them. She names names. Here's looking at you,&nbsp;the Garlic Company&nbsp;in Bakersfield, Calif.<br><br> She charts the toll this work takes on people's health. "My thighs look as though they've been attacked by an enraged but weaponless toddler," she writes after a day of garlic picking. "My hands, swollen and inundated with blisters the first few days, have acclimatized, but there's a worrisome pain shooting up my right arm." She develops a sprain, which forces her to miss work and ultimately quit. Other workers, she notes, would not have that option.<br><br> Among this book's central points is that food workers are, in terms of money and time, among the least able to eat well in America. Most are too exhausted to cook. "By the time I finish my stint at Applebee's," Ms. McMillan says, "I'll have learned how to spot the other members of my tribe on the subway: heavy-lidded eyes, blank stares, black pants specked with grease, hard-soled black shoes."<br><br> Ms. McMillan's chapters about Walmart and Applebee's are the book's best. She is not a slash-and-burn critic of either company: both provide needed jobs and treat their employees at least moderately well. But you will steer clear of both places after reading about her travails.<br><br> The produce sold at the Walmart where she works is second-rate, often slimy, mushy or merely bland. "Walmart doesn't always have the freshest stuff," one manager says to her.

Still more simply wondered. No one denied that it was excellent local color to have a self-proclaimed witch born hardly a stone's throw away from a tree with a reputation.<br><br>Nash Kirkland considered it an amusing fact and an interesting hook. He spent a great deal of his time studying the supernatural. Vampires and werewolves and things that went bump in the night were a hell of a way to make a living. And he wouldn't have had it any other way.<br><br>Not that he believed in goblins or ghoulies&#x2014;or witches, if it came to that.

He wasn't above popping into the neighborhood movie theater and happily devouring popcorn while the audience caught their breath, stifled screams or covered their eyes.<br><br>He delighted in knowing that the people who plunked down the price of a ticket to see one of his movies were going to get their money's worth of chills.<br><br>He always researched carefully. While writing the gruesome and amusing <em>Midnight Blood,</em> he'd spent a week in Romania interviewing a man who swore he was a direct descendant of Vlad, the Impaler&#x2014;Count Dracula. Unfortunately, the count's descendant hadn't grown fangs or turned into a bat, but he had proven to possess a wealth of vampire lore and legend.<br><br>It was such folktales that inspired Nash to spin a story&#x2014;particularly when they were related by someone whose belief gave them punch.<br><br>And people considered him weird, he thought, grinning to himself as he passed the entrance to Seventeen Mile Drive. Nash knew he was an ordinary, grounded-to-earth type. At least by California standards. He just made his living from illusion, from playing on basic fears and superstitions&#x2014;and the pleasure people took in being scared silly. He figured his value to society was his ability to take the monster out of the closet and flash it on the silver screen in Technicolor, usually adding a few dashes of unapologetic sex and sly humor.<br><br>Nash Kirkland could bring the bogeyman to life, turn the gentle Dr. Jekyll into the evil Mr. Hyde, or invoke the mummy's curse.

Catch up on the adventures of degenerate genius Rick Sanchez and his bumbling grandson Morty as they explore the outer reaches of time, space, and anatomy. This volume features writer Tom Fowler in collaboration with series artist CJ Cannon in a three-issue tale of missing heads, galactic doom toasters, and Jerry screwing everything up (of course). Also included is "READY PLAYER MORTY," in which Rick takes Morty to a High School Simulation planet, by writer Pamela Ribon and artist Marc Ellerby, as well as a high-action deathball tournament one-shot written and drawn by Tom Fowler. Come for the jokes, stay for the soul-crushing ennui.</p><p>CJ Cannon is a self-taught artist living in Nashville, Tennessee.

His own comics (which you should totally check out!) are Chloe Noonan: Monster Hunter and Ellerbisms. You can read some comics if you like at marcellerby.com.BOOKLIST -- "Rick and Morty, the unlikely pair at the heart of the hit Adult Swim cartoon, happily bring their signature blend of brainy sci-fi and surreal, warped mayhem to print. When dissolute genius Rick builds a device to predict the future of the stock market, he and his bumbling teenage grandson, Morty, hit the big time. But time cops catch on to their scheme, and they're sentenced to prison in a tortuous labyrinth. That's a tidy metaphor for most Rick and Morty plots, since Rick has his fingers in just about every parallel universe, so moments of sentimentality can easily turn on a dime with an interdimensional leap (and a knowing wink ro the reader), hurtling hapless Morty in myriad disorienting directions. Though readers unfamiliar with the show might be thrown off by the idiosyncratic speech style, it's a pitch-perfect replica of the voice actors' performances, and the artwork, full of exaggerated cartoon shapes and grotesque creatures, expertly mimics the animation. With intelligent plots and lowbrow jokes aplenty, this is tailor-made for older teens." <br>LIBRARY JOURNAL -- "Aside from the normal difficulties inherent in being young, such as school and the trials and tribulations of parents, siblings, and friends, Morty also has to deal with his grandfather Rick, a cracked scientific genius with authority issues. Under Rick's belch-fueled tutelage, the daringly duplicitous duo embark on various outrageous adventures, including making a fortune in the stock market by manipulating multiple universes to ensure maximum profit, getting arrested by time police and sent to a death-maze of Rick's design, and experiencing a haunted campground in the land of dreams. Rick's crazy ideas keep them one step ahead of the problems he instigates, while Morty tries to maintain a level head and survive. Verdict Based on Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland's (adult swim) animated cartoon, Rick and Morty walks a shredding tightrope among slapstick, pathos, and hilarity, with unexpected twists and a healthy sprinkle of nutty sf concepts thrown in for good measure. The anthology nature of the stories means some pieces are stronger than others, but all are imaginative and will appeal to fans of weird sf humor that borders on the psychedelic. Fans of the original series will see new takes on their favorite characters.&#x201d;<br>NEWSARAMA -- "Bottom line, if you love the show, you'll love the comic, and if you've never watched the show, this debut issue will make you want to run out and buy the DVDs as soon as you are humanly able. Oni Press has struck gold with Rick and Morty #1. Zac Gorman, C.J. Cannon, Ryan Hill, and back up artist Marc Ellerby have given audiences, both in and out of know, a solid debut issue chocked with comedy and pathos that can go nowhere but up. Sitcoms are always tricky for comics to really take to, but the breathless insanity and solid emotional core of Rick and Morty may be the latest one that the medium embraces and takes to a whole other crop of fans. To sum it all up, WUB A LUB A DUB DUUUUB!"<br>JUNKIE MONKEYS -- "If Rick and Morty isn't in your comic book collection by now, then you are missing out on one outrageous and dynamic tale! The series is taking off fast and there is still time to jump onto this chaotic ship before it gets too deep into space. Plenty of laughs await you, and trust me when I tell you that you won't be disappointed." <br>WE THE NERDY -- "I'd definitely suggest you buy this if you are a fan of the two loveable idiots because it embodies everything that is great about the Adult Swim show.Rick and Morty is here to stay, so I suggest that you become acquainted with it." <br>COMICS ALLIANCE -- "It's as restlessly inventive as the show, taking you to new worlds and letting Rick and Morty be as awful as ever within them." <br>FOX FORCE FIVE NEWS -- "Rick &amp; Morty is the perfect book to sit down with for a good laugh and a little adventure." <br>ADVENTURES IN POOR TASTE -- "One of the most popular shows right now (okay fine the most popular show right now) is on hiatus so this is the only way to get your Rick and Morty fix!"<br>MOVIEPILOT.COM -- "The new run of Rick and Morty's comic book series is set to arrive very soon.

The suburbs of southern Florida were row after row of single-level ranch houses and manicured lawns. I was eleven, filled with restless, inexplicable feelings. It was just before the dawn of puberty. Except for what I could glean from my brother&#x2019;s dirty magazines, sex was still an abstraction. Some other secret thing was beckoning. I had caught glimpses when I heard the music coming from his room, so different from my own small collection of Bay City Rollers and Bee Gees 45s. One by one, I began to play his records, holding the sleeves in my lap, trying to learn the grammar of this new musical language. I was not quite prepared for what I found. His music made me feel hot and cold at the same time, a small fire starting in my belly while shivers ran up my spine. Here was a seductive and impenetrable catalogue of arcane and occult symbols, of magic and mystical pursuits, of strange rituals involving sex, spaceships, and faeries. I went into his room looking to hear some real rock and roll. I came out spellbound and hypnotized by the spectacle.</p><p>The record collection was a lexicon of the gods: the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Arthur Brown, King Crimson, Hawkwind, Yes, Black Sabbath, and Pink Floyd. Already immersed in the arcana of the 1970s by way of J. R. R. Tolkien reprints, Dungeons &amp; Dragons&#x2014;almost universally known as D&amp;D&#x2014;<i>Heavy Metal</i> magazine, horror comics, and the animated films of Ralph Bakshi, I sat in long hours of deep listening, studying the lyrics, the album cover art, and even the hidden messages etched into the inner ring of the vinyl. I searched for the clues to Paul McCartney&#x2019;s rumored death and felt the chill of ghosts staring out from the cover of <i>Abbey Road</i>, the barefoot Beatle unwittingly symbolizing his own demise through some terrible necromancy. I held the vinyl of <i>Led Zeppelin III</i> up to the light so I could search for the fabled occult missive carved into the record&#x2019;s inner ring: &#x201c;Do what thou wilt.&#x201d; I stared in nervous fascination at the various characters inhabited by David Bowie and tried to crack the mystery of his lyrics that told of aliens, Aleister Crowley, and supergods who are &#x201c;guardians of a loveless isle.&#x201d; Black Sabbath was formed by sorcerers, working their dark art through heavy doom-laden riffs. Arthur Brown admitted he was the &#x201c;god of hellfire.&#x201d;</p><p>The music became a fixture of my psyche. I thought I alone had uncovered a well of arcane truth, like the paperback <i>Necronomicon</i> that sat on my bookshelf. There was something both transcendent and abysmal lurking within the grooves of these records and the fantastic lives of the characters inhabiting them. Roger Dean&#x2019;s artwork on Yes albums were landscapes once populated by ancient races, their arcane wisdom lost, sunken like Atlantis. At the other end of the spectrum was the Beatles&#x2019; impenetrable and terrifying penultimate song on the <i>White Album</i>, &#x201c;Revolution 9,&#x201d; a spoken-word, feedback-infused collage of hidden occult messages suggesting a palpable violence. These often opposing qualities nonetheless shared a common thread: they referenced a reality beyond normal perception, a vast metaverse inhabited by demons and angels, aliens and ancient sorcerers, all of which could be accessed by potentially dangerous methods such as magic, drugs, and maybe even sex. But I also sensed the peril in reading too deeply into these songs and albums. The film <i>Helter Skelter</i>, often shown on the UHF channels&#x2019; late-night movie programs, taught me that fixating on a band&#x2019;s life and work can sometimes take a fanatical turn. In this instance, an album helped to precipitate a murderous call to arms when Charles Manson believed the Beatles were sending him secret, violent messages through their music. Although the connection between the music and the murders was overblown, my adolescent self couldn&#x2019;t shake the feeling there <i>was something</i> to the Beatles&#x2019; songs that made this kind of interpretation possible. And sure, it was crazy to think so and everyone knew it wasn&#x2019;t true, but maybe, just maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Paul really was dead.</p><p>Despite my ambivalence about my teenage fantasies, my brother&#x2019;s albums really were a glimpse into the sometimes explicit, sometimes hidden occult language of rock, a window into the pervasive influence of magic and mysticism on the most essential and influential art form of the twentieth century. Within a single collection representing a microcosm of rock history and styles was another hidden story, of how rock&#x2014;its songs and its staging, its lyrics and its pyrotechnics&#x2014;have been shaped by magical and mystical symbols, ideas, and practices.</p><p>Like many teenagers in those days, I wondered if magic really did exist outside the lists of spells in the D&amp;D <i>Player&#x2019;s Handbook</i>. I bought books on white magic and lit candles, making sure the window was open so as to not alert my mother, who was ever on the lookout for the danger of an open flame. My friends and I dimmed the lights and hovered our fingers over the plastic planchette of my Ouija board. Nothing seemed to manifest. I could not pull out of thin air the potent feelings that came from those records. There was magic here, but it was even bigger than I could have imagined. From between the gatefold covers, from the vinyl tucked snugly into the sleeves, an enchantment had been woven that bewitched all of popular culture.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know it then, but I was a participant in a vast cultural phenomenon. The Beatles had already converted an entire generation of listeners whose ideas about spirituality would be shaped by LSD, tarot cards, and free copies of the Bhagavad Gita handed out by young Hare Krishna devotees. As I listened to <i>Houses of the Holy</i> in my brother&#x2019;s room, Led Zeppelin had already shaped rock&#x2019;s imagination about the power of the magical arts. And only a few years earlier, progressive rock bands had fashioned dreams of inner and outer space, offering otherworldly hope at the closing of the Aquarian dream.</p><p>Rock had used a cloak of glamour in the original use of the word: an enchantment. <i>Glamour</i> is even related to the word <i>grammar</i>, which was sometimes used to denote occult language, the verbal weaving of a spell, and eventually became <i>grimoire,</i> a book of magic. Just as in stage magic, where the audience allows itself to be tricked, to be seduced by the illusion, rock and roll has fed off a similar instinct. A person&#x2019;s willingness to be tricked is how the palm reader plies the trade, the shaman hypnotizes the tribe, and why I listened to those songs and gazed at those album covers in wonder and excitement, certain I was unlocking a chamber where a magical artifact was hidden.</p><p>Those days sitting cross-legged on my brother&#x2019;s floor were an initiation into a mystery cult, where I would become a disciple of rock and roll. Throughout my teenage years, rock was the musical narrative of my inner life. There was always an album that spoke perfectly to whatever inscrutable feelings I was negotiating at the time. Rock&#x2019;s often sphinxlike truths were the key to not only my own inner life; they could open the door into other mysterious realms. Eventually I stopped searching for esoteric riddles on album covers and in song lyrics, but I never ceased being aware of where the occult imagination was at play. It&#x2019;s a plot I&#x2019;ve been following ever since I first opened the gatefold cover to David Bowie&#x2019;s <i>Diamond Dogs</i> album to the grotesquely erotic painting of a caninesque Bowie, half man, half dog. I came to realize that magic cannot exist without a conduit, a means of expression. And even if it can, I am not interested in the metaphysics of the occult. I believe in those horned gods only when I hear them speaking from out of the grooves in the vinyl, the shiny surface of a CD, and even in the sonic reduction of the MP3. And in those moments they are as real as the music itself. I don&#x2019;t need the magic to be anywhere else. It exists as the most potent spell in the awesome spectacle of rock and roll.</p><p>II</p><p>At pivotal moments in its development, rock musicians and their audiences together made an almost unconscious pact to expand their consciousness and push beyond the restraints of traditional American music and its underlying spiritual identity. The occult became rock&#x2019;s very salvation then, taking possession of the imagination of rock musicians and their fans, and redefining popular music and culture. Moreover, the occult imagination saved rock and roll from sugary teenybopper purgatory and urged musicians, engineers, and producers to look beyond the conventional toward the possibility of raising the collective spiritual consciousness into the astral planes. The occult imbued rock with an immortal soul that continues to resonate in Western culture, and musicians and their audiences continue to feed off one another, looking for deeper meaning as a way to make sense of the primal and ancient urges that rock and roll has always evoked.</p><p>Rock is the sound of both spiritual and musical rebellion, and for the long and continuing history of this most indispensable of musical forms, these two things have become inseparable. What is it about rock, more than any other art form of the modern age, that makes it such a perfect vehicle for this ancient and often unconscious drive to penetrate the veil between the phenomenal world and the numinous realm of the spirit? Why have so many musicians staged their rock concerts to appear as moments of shamanic and religious rites and created personas simulating magicians, demons, the gods Pan and Dionysus, even appearing as people possessed by gods or devils or worse? Why have they covered their album covers with images of the occult, conjured their lyrics out of the stuff of legend and myth, and even in their personal lives sought their own mystical and magical experiences? Why have they performed shows in front of ancient relics?</p><p>Rock&#x2019;s spiritual affinity with occultism is due in large part to the nature of the occult itself. The occult&#x2014;the popular term for a wide range of spiritual beliefs and activities concerned with supernatural, Gnostic, magical, and mystical ideas&#x2014;operates within an unorthodox, nonconformist, and sometimes heretical temple, worshipping in ways at odds with the traditional and established religious order. These practices are an attempt by the individual or group to take a more active role in their own spiritual destiny, to commune with the divine through some form of intercession. Spirits, divination, amulets, charms, and even the worship of other deities feel direct and experiential.</p><p>This purposeful drive toward a divine encounter has surfaced in various manifestations throughout history and all over the world: in the Jewish mystics of medieval Europe, in the American Pentecostal Christians, and in the American appropriation of Buddhism and yoga. Christianity would often see this impulse as the work of the devil, even within its own ranks. Renaissance magicians and alchemists such as Giordano Bruno were called heretics, and later Lutheran and other American Christian sects would look on snake handlers and those who spoke in tongues as liars at best, devil worshippers at worst. In many cases, it was Christianity that perpetuated a belief in a pagan lineage through laws against magic and more active and often false accusations such as the infamous witch trials. The use of occult fears for political gains only prolonged superstitions and the other beliefs that religious authorities claimed to be trying to eradicate. Christianity would seal the pagan chamber completely, even as it defined itself by appropriating pagan myths such as the solstice and a resurrecting god. As the instinct for ecstatic experience continued to bubble up, it became by definition heterodox. The original intention of this kind of authentic practice, once organized around communities with rituals bordering on the theatrical and the hypnotic, was mostly lost.</p><p>Until rock and roll.</p><p>The phenomenon is modern, but rock&#x2019;s soul was burnished in the fires of ancient mystery cults, when myth and initiation were fused in a potent mix of dance, intoxication, and other forms of ecstatic revelry. But despite the spectacle of this kind of worship, it&#x2019;s still a simple human need being played out in theatrical ways: it&#x2019;s the desire for community, for myth and ritual, and for direct communion with the divine.</p><p>It&#x2019;s best to imagine the occult roots of rock as an estuary. While early rock and roll can be traced directly to the blues, gospel, and folk, rock&#x2019;s overall development was also shaped by jazz, experimental and early electronic music, and even classical strains. In each of these influences the occult is also present, often exhibiting the same characteristic: artists looking for ways to revolt against convention by using the occult as both an inspiration and a vehicle for their ideas. While rock is essentially a recent phenomenon, it does not exist in a vacuum of modern human experience. Rock is an aspect of the ancient impulse to hammer out sounds on whatever tools are available, to express what it means to be human. For millennia, making music has been inseparable from religious activity. Rock and roll&#x2019;s origins are in the blues and folk&#x2014;forms of music deeply engrained with Christian traditions and values, but whose own roots grew in the soil where other gods were worshipped. As popular music developed, it struggled with this tension between Puritanism and the shadow of other non-Christian traditions that were just as much a part of American music.</p><p>Just as religious traditions have always sought to make sense of their own pagan origins&#x2014;usually by prohibiting and demonizing the old gods&#x2014;ministers, parents, and record-burning mobs saw in rock the threat of sex and chaos. Rock&#x2019;s response was its true salvation: musicians pushed out further, conjuring spirits with power chords. When rock was finding its electric sound and its hormonal teenage audience, it chose sex as its expression of agitation. This was its first claim to autonomy, a wriggle of the hips in the face of the religious hierarchy. As rock critic Dan Graham explains: &#x201c;Rock turned the values of traditional religion on their head. To rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll meant to have sex&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. NOW.&#x201d; Because the mainstream church often saw sex as a symptom of ungodliness and the influence of evil spirits, rock musicians felt the good burn of rebellion as they plugged in their amps, calling out to a greater salvation than Christian redemption: &#x201c;When the chimes ring five, six, and seven, / We&#x2019;ll be right in seventh heaven.&#x201d;</p><p>Rock&#x2019;s erotic tension gave it the label of devil&#x2019;s music, its very soul seen as having been burnished in the fires of one of the first sins: human sexual awareness. Rock&#x2019;s first words were sexual, drawn from deeply explicit blues lyrics and the very physicality of its rhythms, themselves arising out of ancient soil. As the American slaves were developing their own form of Christianity that used song as the essential form of worship, they tread carefully even as they incorporated African tribal music and movement. Slaves would shuffle around in a...</p></p><h2>Murder at the Boat Club: a cozy 1920s murder mystery (A Ginger Gold Mystery)</h2><p><p><b><em>&#x201c;Clever and entertaining, you&#x2019;ll love this charming Golden Age mystery series.

Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><p>Broadcaster <b>Al Roker</b> is the weather anchor on NBC's <i>The Today Show</i> and co-host of <i>Wake Up with Al</i> on The Weather Channel.

Unprecedented in its scope, it examines the many different manifestations of the body in art, from Anthony Gormley and Maya Lin sculptures to eight-armed Hindu gods and ancient Greek reliefs, from feminist graphics and Warhol's empty electric chair to the blue-tinted complexion of Singer Sargent's Madame X. It is the most expansive examination of the human body in art, spanning western and non-western, ancient to contemporary, representative to abstract and conceptual.</p><p>Over 400 artists are featured in chapters that explore identity, beauty, religion, absent body, sex and gender, power, body's limits, abject body and bodies &amp; space. Works range from 11,000 BC hand stencils in Argentine caves to videos and performances by contemporary artists such as Marina Abramovic, Joan Jonas and Bruce Nauman? Its fresh, accessible and dynamic voice brings to life the thrilling diversity of both classical and contemporary art through the prism of the body. More than simply a book of representations, this is an original and thought provoking look at the human body across time, cultures and media.</p></p><p><p><em>Body of Art</em> is conceived and edited by Phaidon Editors.

A forty-year-old encyclopedia of style titled <i>Elegance</i>, this slim volume by formidable French fashion expert Madame Dariaux promises to transform even the plainest of women into creatures of poise and grace. It is a fairy godmother in print, an A-to-Z manual with essential advice that Louise vows to take to heart. But within its pages lie not only clues from her past, but also powerful lessons for the future. And as the old Louise gives way to the stunning new, she's about to find out that there's more to every life than what appears on the surface . . . and that everything, even elegance, has its price.</p></p><p><p>Kathleen Tessaro is the author of <em>Elegance</em>, <em>Innocence</em>,<em> The Flirt</em>,<em> The Debutante</em>,<em> The Perfume Collector</em>, and <em>Rare Objects</em>. She lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with her husband and son.</p>A frumpy, depressed woman is reborn as an assertive diva in Tessaro's debut novel, thanks to a 40-year-old style manual she discovers in a second-hand bookstore. Louise Canova is an American woman from Pittsburgh who lives in London with her chilly actor husband. Louise once dabbled in acting herself, but now works at a theater box office. She's overweight, badly dressed, has purely platonic relations with her husband and is surrounded by more-glamorous-than-thou types-her friend Nicki, a former model; her mother-in-law, a former model and a socialite-who condescend to her. Everything changes, however, when Louise discovers Elegance, a fashion guide from 1964 written by Genevieve Dariaux, a legendary (and fictional) Coco Chanel-like arbiter of taste. Quoting liberally from the guidebook, Tessaro writes a lighthearted contemporary version of Pygmalion. In this case, Louise is her own Professor Higgins, and using Dariaux's amusingly anachronistic (is anyone wearing veils these days?) yet timeless advice ("being beautiful is no guarantee of happiness in this world"), she changes her appearance, her self-image and her entire life. The author introduces each chapter with a relevant excerpt from the manual. This structure sometimes seems a bit forced, especially when Louise's husband turns out to be gay (there is no worthwhile advice from Madam Dariaux on that situation), but on the whole the book is a lively, irresistible read. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Last of the Name</h2><p><p>Twelve-year-old Danny O'Carolan and his sister, Kathleen, arrive in New York City in 1863. Kathleen refuses to be parted from her only remaining relative, so she finds a job in domestic service for herself and her younger...<em>sister</em>. Danny reluctantly pretends to be a girl to avoid being sent to the children's workhouse or recruited as a drummer boy for the Union army. When he occasionally sneaks off to spend a few hours as a boy and share his rich talent for Irish dancing, he discovers the vast variety of New York's neighborhoods. But the Civil War draft is stoking tensions between the Irish and free black populations. With dangers escalating, how can Danny find a safe place to call home?</p></p><p><p><strong>Rosanne Parry </strong>is the author of six middle grade novels.

She lives with her family in an historic farmhouse and writes in a treehouse in her backyard.</p><p>"Parry intrigues with a tale of 12-year-old Danny O'Carolan, who has fled Ireland for a new life in 1860s New York City. With his older sister and the musical traditions of his Irish home, Danny finds a tough new world in America. With very few jobs available for boys, and a burning desire to avoid the orphanage, he agrees to pretend to be a girl in order to be employed as a maid with his older sister. However, the Civil War is raging and the draft looms&#x2015;with an expanding Irish population making an ideal draft target. Middle grade readers with an interest in historical fiction will enjoy this selection. Parry is successful at detailing the Irish immigrant experience in America. She retains a youthful perspective on the important, relevant topics of immigration and acceptance.

With the threat of starvation, disease, violence, and racism on every corner, life in 1863 New York City is scarcely better for two orphans trying to find their way in the world. Danny is tempted to join the Union Army, but Kathleen insists they stay together. Unfortunately, the only work available is that of a lady's maid and a laundress. Danny gamely dons a dress in hopes of passing as a girl, but he lives for the mornings when he can escape into the city and be himself. There, he earns pennies for his dancing and singing and attracts the attention of a man who owns a theater. But he also learns that the Irish are hated not just for their faith, but because they are competing for low-wage jobs with the native-born population, including African-Americans, setting the stage for the unrest that caused the New York City draft riots. Familiar historical events are given new life through Danny's wide-eyed optimism and Kathleen's determination. And while the principals are Irish, their neighborhood boasts as diverse a population as modern Manhattan. An author's note further explains the explosive events of 1863 as the population of New York City swelled with a wave of immigrants. <strong>An exuberant dash through a pivotal year in American history.</strong>"&#x2015;starred, <em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Civil War New York springs to life with danger, humor, and grit.

In one of the few moments out on the streets as himself, he's noticed for his dancing and his pure, golden voice. Could it be their ticket out of this hardscrabble existence? <strong>Textured and well-researched, Parry's latest historical novel brings to life New York City during the peak of the Civil War</strong>, particularly the tensions between the Irish immigrants and freedmen, as well as the looming draft riots.

It draws on things both old and new: on the wisdom of the Bible, enshrined in Benedictine liturgy, on the experience of modern monks, and on the wisdom of the Christian Church throughout her long and varied history. Coming as it does from an Irish monastery, it reflects in a special way the Celtic tradition with its earthy, popular and devotional prayers. Beautifully bound and designed, it is both prayer and inspiration.</p><p>The first section is a simplified Liturgy of the Hours to dedicate and bless those two great moments of the day that bear witness to Christ: morning, when we celebrate his rising as the light of the world, and evening, when we acclaim him as the unquenchable light that never sets. Through psalms, canticles, and other words of scripture, through invocations and concluding prayers, the day is hallowed and the presence of the risen Christ is gratefully remembered.</p><p>In addition, elements have been included stemming from the ancient custom of consecrating special moments to the Lord in the bustle of the daily round. These "prayer-stops" are the modern equivalent to monastic &#x201c;Little Hours,&#x201d; recalling as they do the coming of the Holy Spirit and the dramatic events of Christ's passion. They are an invitation and an opportunity to pause in the midst of work and turn our hearts to God.</p><p>Night prayer (Compline), the last monastic office of the day, is included as the prayer before sleep. Its haunting psalms and canticles, its prayers for protection, its calling upon Mary are some of the most beautiful treasures from the storehouse of monastic prayer. They lead us gently across the bridge of sleep, from the glaring light of day to the dark cradle of the night and the world of dreams.</p><p>This liturgical section includes a seasonal element so that the great festivals of the Christian year may be incorporated in our prayer, and a calendar of saints&#x2019; days so that they can be commemorated. A selection of prayers for that purpose is also provided. These can be used in place of the prayer at the end of morning and evening prayer.</p><p>The second section consists of familiar prayers, those tried and tested prayer texts stretching back through the centuries: the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer, the Apostles&#x2019; Creed, the Stations of the Cross, the Rosary, and many others.</p><p>The third section, ritual prayers, provides prayer forms for various needs and occasions as they arise in every life, and a series of blessings. It will be a valuable and useful resource for the many times when spoken or formal prayers are looked for in situations of necessity, sorrow, joy, or grief. The Celtic element is particularly marked in this part of the book. There is also a special prayer for Benedictine Oblates.</p><p>The fourth and final part includes psalms (to supplement the liturgical section or for meditation) and a series of quotations from the Rule of Saint Benedict. The latter, encapsulating the wisdom of this great foundational text of Christian civilization, can be read as part of night prayer (Compline) or simply meditated or ruminated upon as a source of inspiration in one&#x2019;s spiritual life.</p><p>Thus, <i>The Glenstal Book of Prayer</i> provides for the whole sweep of prayer. It captures that movement of the Holy Spirit in the human heart that is prayer and through which God reaches out and embraces us.</p><p>Includes two-color printing throughout and a ribbon marker.</p></p><p>The Glenstal Book of Prayer is a rich resource for the dark, mysterious, but exciting journey which is prayer.

Author of the best-selling Spontaneous Healing and Eight Weeks to Optimum Health, he traveled the world experiencing and studying healers and healing systems and has earned an international reputation as an expert on alternative medicine, mind-body interactions, and medical botany. He is the associate director of the Division of Social Perspectives in Medicine and the director of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona in Tucson.1.<br>What This Book Is About<br><br>This book is an exposition of a theory that can help us. It is not a primer of pharmacology or a program for social reform. Rather, it is the germ of a new way of thinking about drugs and consciousness a way that creates possibilities for solving a problem that divides us bitterly in our nation, in our schools, and in our homes.<br> I have been actively interested in drugs that affect the mind for the past ten years, and during that time I have had many opportunities to write this book. I have declined to do so until now for a number of reasons that are pertinent to the ideas I intend to develop in these pages. Before I discuss them, let me state briefly why I now wish to write.<br> The growing presence in our midst of chemicals that seem to alter consciousness raises questions of the utmost importance for us as individuals and as social beings. Examples of these questions are: What do these drugs tell us about the relationship between mind and body? Are they legitimate tools (in any sense) for changing the mind in a direction of greater awareness? How can a society come to terms with the individual urge to alter awareness? These questions are important because they bear directly on the nature of consciousness, which is, ultimately, the only problem worthy of total intellectual effort. It is the concern of all the world&#x2019;s philosophies and religions, other problems being less precise statements of the same thing. All of us are working on the problem of consciousness on some level, and the conclusions we come to determine what we think about ourselves and the universe, how we live, and how we act. The complex phenomena associated with drugs in our country seem to me to be significant pieces of evidence to be taken into account in this process clues to help us in our work whether we use drugs or not. It would be useful to have this evidence presented clearly and unemotionally.<br> In directing attention to matters of consciousness, I am not ignoring or minimizing the very real problems associated with drugs. Our news media are full of documented reports on the tragic consequences of the misuse of chemical agents in search of highs. But having acknowledged the reality of these problems, I propose to find solutions to them by looking to the positive aspects of the drug experience rather than to the negative ones (which are visible all around us). By positive I mean simply tending in the direction of increase or progress&#x201d; rather than the reverse, and I will attempt to justify this methodology in the course of the book.<br> During my years as a drug expert (a role I now cheerfully abandon) I have sat through a great many conferences about drugs attended by all sorts of people, but I have never heard the important questions given the attention they deserve. Instead, I have listened to pharmacologists arguing over changes (or possibly no changes) in the chromosomes of rats exposed to LSD, to users rambling on about the purely hedonistic aspects of drug experience, to physicians pretending to themselves that medical science can explain the subjective effects of drugs, to parents and educators begging for methods to make youngsters turn away from drugs, and so on and so on. These discussions have been emotionally charged, but the intellectual level has been uniformly low, whether the participants have been psychiatrists or addicts, students or policemen. I have waited for years for the talk to get around to the interesting questions, but it never has. Nor does it look as if it will. Consequently, I have resolved to stop going to drug conferences and to write instead.<br> In addition, I have collected an unusual body of information on this subject that I feel obligated to share with people who are interested in the meaningful questions. Through a series of coincidences I have had a chance to look at drugs from the point of view of a journalist, a user, an ethnobotanist, a physician, a laboratory pharmacologist, a drug abuse expert,&#x201d; and a federal government employee. No one of these viewpoints by itself enabled me to understand what I saw or to come to any useful conclusions. But gradually, from all the experiences I have had in these diverse positions, certain unifying themes have emerged. And to my great surprise, the principles that I have begun to discern leave me profoundly optimistic about the possibility of extricating ourselves from the desperate situation we now find ourselves in. In the following chapters I will describe how I have arrived at certain conclusions and will go into some detail about the reasons for my optimism.<br> Among the considerations that have kept me from writing until now, the emotionalism of the subject has bbeen uppermost in my mind. Drugs are not an emotionally neutral topic of discourse. There is no such thing as a disinterested drug expeeeeert, despite the stance of many scientists who claim to be presenting purely objective information. This is so precisely because the issues raised by drugs touch so closely upon our profoundest hopes and fears. Everyone who speaks or writes about drugs (and certainly all who investigate&#x201d; them) together with everyone who hears or reads what is said and written has an emotional involvement with the information. The exact nature of this involvement differs from person to person in both degree and quality, but it is always there. Consequently, it is extremely difficult to talk about drugs except in a direct interpersonal situation, where, at least, there is some possibility of monitoring emotional reactions.<br> In the course of my writings and lectures I have learned that people hear what they want to hear and tune out what they do not want to hear. I have also observed that the distortions of communication caused by emotional investments in preconceived notions are most damaging in groups that regard themselves to be free of such notions, such as physicians and pharmacologists.<br> Where a topic provokes emotional reactions, one may expect to see a closely related process of polarization in which divergent interpretations of data develop. The controversies that divide us over drugs illustrate this process well, for they are not so much battles over observations as battles over the significance to be attached to observations. No careful observer doubts that heavy marijuana smoking correlates with an amotivational syndrome&#x201d; characterized by lassitude, indifference, and a neurotic inability to accomplish things society considers important. But as soon as we try to interpret that correlation we run into trouble. Is heavy marijuana smoking a cause of amotivation, as many psychiatrists tell us, or is it simply another manifestation of an underlying (and unknown) psychological process? At every turn in our examination of observations concerned with drugs, we are forced to choose between rival interpretations. What are the real facts?<br> The answer, very simply, is that there are no facts. Or, more precisely, there are no facts uncontaminated by some degree of value judgment. Of course, the greater the emotional investments (or biases) of the participants in this muddle, the greater will be the degree of contamination. I cannot emphasize too strongly that everything we hear and read today about drugs is affected in this way; all facts put forth about drugs are merely masquerading as such. Nor can I repeat too often that the problem is likely to be most serious in just those cases where it appears to be absent. As I shall show in a later chapter, the pharmacologist who just gives the facts&#x201d; about ecstasy, heroin, and marijuana is often interpreting data through the distortions of biases so sweeping and so internally consistent that they remain invisible and unconscious.<br> These considerations place serious obstacles in the way of anyone who wants to understand what drugs mean. To get by them, we must be carefully discriminating about the information we choose to build theories on. A useful first step is an attempt to estimate the degree and kind of bias present, a practice that should become habitual. To check on the extent of conscious bias, one might ask oneself, Does the person giving me this information have any special case to make for or against drugs? In most instances today the answer will be yes. Law enforcement officers have a personal stake in making drugs look bad; regular users have a personal stake in making them look good. This is garden-variety bias and requires no special aptitude to spot; you just have to remember to ask the question. An affirmative answer does not mean that one should ignore the information, only that one should be alert to the possibility that observations have been interpreted one way rather than another on the basis of relatively meaningless criteria.<br> Unconscious bias is harder to detect and much more important to try to identify. The question to ask is, Does the person giving this information view the subject from a special perspective that might limit the validity of his or her generalizations? Unconscious bias is as common among proponents of drugs as among opponents. Here are two glaring examples, one from each pole. When I was conducting human experiments with marijuana in Boston in 1968, a Federal Narcotics Bureau agent told me that no matter how my experiments came out, he would remain convinced that marijuana makes people aggressive and violent.&#x201d; My research had nothing to do with that possibility, but I asked him what his evidence was for his belief. He had one piece of evidence dating from the early 1950s, when he had been seized by a curiosity to watch people smoke the drug. (His official duties were exclusively concerned with large-scale underworld heroin traffic and he had never come into contact with actual users of marijuana.) Accordingly, he had disguised himself as a beatnik and made his way to a Greenwich Village pot party. When he revealed himself as a ...</p><h2>Money Drunk, Money Sober; 90 Days to Financial Freedom</h2><p>In a society where it is often easier to discuss sex than money, many of us have hidden issues about personal finances.

Kerr lived in Taiwan in the late 1930s, when the island was a colony of Japan. During the war, he worked for the U.S. Navy as a Taiwan expert. From 1945 to 1947, Kerr served as vice consul of the U.S. diplomatic mission in Taipei, where he was an eyewitness to the February 28 Massacre and the subsequent mass arrests and executions.</p><p>As well as chronicling KMT repression during the early years of the White Terror, Kerr documents widespread corruption, showing how the island was systematically looted. The "betrayed" in the title refers not only to the crushing disappointment Taiwanese felt when they realized KMT rule was worse than that of the Japanese but also to the culpability of the American government. The United States was in large part responsible for handing Taiwan over to the Nationalists and helping them maintain their grip on power.</p><p><em>Formosa Betrayed</em> has served as a foundational text for generations of Taiwanese democracy and independence activists. It has an explosive effect among overseas Taiwanese students; for many, the book was their first encounter in print with their country's dark, forbidden history.

It is a powerful classic that has withstood the test of time, a must-read book that will change the way you look at Taiwan.</p><p>In this definitive edition Kerr scholar Jonathan Benda has added a detailed, thoroughly-researched introduction as well as a biographical sketch of the author.</p></p><p><p>"Mr. Kerr's book deserves wide attention not only because of the authority which thirty years of involvement with his subject confers, but also because it is the only book to expose the whole truth of a critical problem."<br> <br> --<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p></p><h2>Mario Buatta: Fifty Years of American Interior Decoration</h2><p>The eagerly anticipated first monograph to celebrate the fifty-years-and-counting career of decorating legend Mario Buatta.

The book shows how the government is based on war, both against foreign nations and against the American people themselves, through massive invasions of our liberties. Fueled by an out-of-control banking system, the American State has become in essence fascist. We cannot escape our predicament through limited government: the government is incapable of controlling itself.

Three strong Manchu emperors worked diligently to secure an alliance with the conquered Ming gentry, though many of their social edicts&#x2015;especially the requirement that ethnic Han men wear queues&#x2015;were fiercely resisted. As advocates of a &#x201c;universal&#x201d; empire, Qing rulers also achieved an enormous expansion of the Chinese realm over the course of three centuries, including the conquest and incorporation of Turkic and Tibetan peoples in the west, vast migration into the southwest, and the colonization of Taiwan. </p><p>Despite this geographic range and the accompanying social and economic complexity, the Qing ideal of &#x201c;small government&#x201d; worked well when outside threats were minimal. But the nineteenth-century Opium Wars forced China to become a player in a predatory international contest involving Western powers, while the devastating uprisings of the Taiping and Boxer rebellions signaled an urgent need for internal reform. Comprehensive state-mandated changes during the early twentieth century were not enough to hold back the nationalist tide of 1911, but they provided a new foundation for the Republican and Communist states that would follow. </p><p>This original, thought-provoking history of China&#x2019;s last empire is a must-read for understanding the challenges facing China today.</p></p><p><p>William T.

Kent Guy, University of Washington</b><br><br>&#x201c;Here is a new narrative for Chinese history. It is based on the path-breaking scholarship of a small body of principally American scholars who have shown that after the non-Han Manchus conquered the Ming in 1644, traditional China was gradually replaced by something very different. This meant that the previous explanations, emanating from the Harvard school, led by the persuasive John King Fairbank, which emphasized a succession of essentially unchanging dynasties, must be abandoned...In short, as Professor Rowe sets out in this important book, "the inward-looking and hermetic Celestial Empire" has vanished and something far more interesting has come convincingly before us.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jonathan Mirsky</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A very fine book, drawing on the best new scholarship on this pivotal period in Chinese history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>K.

The American pilot, Tom Coyle, had already fought in two wars and had no desire to fight in a third when he was hired by the French Airforce to fly cargo missions. "No combat, just cargo" was what the contract read. His job was high pay and low risk when compared to the bomber missions he flew in World War II and Korea... and that was&nbsp;the way&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;it.All that changed when Coyle met Brigitte Friang, a French war correspondent assigned to cover the courageous paratroopers jumping into the northern highlands of Vietnam. Constantly on the move in the most dangerous of places, Brigitte was not the easiest girl to court, but Coyle was inexplicably drawn to her and determined to win her over.&nbsp;Things became even more complicated when Brigitte discovered that the commander of the para battalion she was sent to cover was her former lover and fellow French resistance fighter, Major "Bruno" Bigeard. The two rivals in the unspoken love triangle soon become friends when both struggled to protect Brigitte as the battle raged.&nbsp;But time was running out for Brigitte, Coyle, and&nbsp;Bruno as the Viet Minh closed in on the French garrison to cut it off from the outside world. Bound by duty, Brigitte was determined to stay and Coyle was forced to choose between surrendering his quest to win Brigitte's heart or joining a fight that could end with his ultimate sacrifice.Powerful and compelling,&nbsp;<i>We Stand Alone</i>&nbsp;is an epic war novel written in the tradition of <i><i>For Whom The Bell Tolls&nbsp;</i>and <em>From Here to Eternity</em>, but with the modern intensity of <i><em>Matterhorn</em>.</i></i><i><i></i>Indochina was a neglected crystal ball that became the war before the war.

When these claims were ignored or challenged, he purportedly used his powers to produce earthquakes, civil unrest, UFO sightings, strange weather events, and other powerful phenomena. Owens even threatened to down aircraft to garner attention.</p><p>Was there any truth to Owens' abilities, or was he a fraud with a knack for picking the times and places of catastrophes? Jeffrey Mishlove, PhD, a respected parapsychologist and host of the popular public television program <em>Thinking Allowed</em>, analyzes correspondence, interviews, newspaper reports, and remarkable life of "the world's greatest psychic," as Owens claimed to be. Whether Owens was a prodigious liar and dangerous con-man, or a true but unbalanced master who used his incredible powers primarily for petty acts of revenge, many questions remain, and the implications for the rest of us are staggering.</p></p><p>The PK Man is an adventure and research project in which I was engaged for over 10 years, studying a man named Ted Owens. He was a most unusual man, whose powers were of shamanistic proportions. Everything that I present in this book, unbelievable, as it may seem, did actually occur and I have the documentation to prove it. <p>The story began in 1976; Owens sent a letter to Russell Targ and Hal Puthoff, two parapsychologists at the Stanford Research Institute. His letter stated he would end the drought that was then plaguing California. He said he would make it rain, snow, sleet and hail. There would be blackouts, and UFO sightings. Within three days all of these things happened. </p><p>Owens was a Speaker at the London Parascience Conference held at the University of London, he claimed that he was an agent of the UFOs. He was their Ambassador and he had come to Earth to perform miraculous feats to end the droughts. To do wonderful things for people on Earth, he even called himself PK Man, meaning the &#x201c;Psychokinesis Man,&#x201d; the man who had power of mind over matter. </p><p>Later, Ted Owens showed me his files, as I looked through the many documents illustrating instances where he'd produced a wide variety of phenomena, I found a letter from Dr. Max Fogel, the Director of Education for MENSA, an organization for people with high IQ's. The letter stated that in 1973 Owens promised Vogel he would produce a UFO sighting within a 100mile radius of Norfolk, Virginia. A UFO did appear witnessed by a policeman. I asked Ted Owens if he would produce a similar demonstration for me. Could he make a UFO appear and be seen by reliable witnesses? He told me could make a UFO appear in front of hundreds of reliable witnesses. It'll be well attested. The story of that successful demonstration is one of the many that I present in The PK Man.</p>&#34;One evening late in December 1985, Ted Owens phoned Jeffrey Mishlove to warn him in an angry voice that the US Governement must cancel the next space shuttle flight. &#39;This is the most important call you will ever receive,&#39; Owens said. &#39;The S.I.&#39;s [Space Intellegences] really mean business.&#39; They will destroy the shuttle, it&#39;s up to you to prevent it. A month later, on January 28, 1986, Mishlove was &#39;shaken to my bones&#39; when the challenger space shuttle exploded, killing its seven crew members, including thirty-seven year old teacher Christa McAuliffe. &#39;I realize that I had been ignoring Owens too long,&#39; Mishlove writes in this remarkable story.&#34; So begins Jeffrey Mishlove&#39;s &#34;The PK Man,&#34; the true and strange story of Ted Owens, whose claims of powerful psychokinetic abilities given to him by &#34;Space Intelligences&#34; were too bizarre and extreme for many to believe.

The first sentence of the first story, "Love Is Not a Pie," evinces the contradictions, layers, and interconnections of her narrator's existence--and hooks the reader entirely. "In the middle of the eulogy at my mother's boring and heart-breaking funeral, I began to think about calling off the wedding." The title phrase means exactly what it says: Lila's mother didn't have a finite amount of affection and was lucky not to be forced to choose between love's accepted forms and a more unusual one: "People think that it can't be that way, but it can. You just have to find the right people." Lila realizes that she needs to get out of her engagement because she isn't ready for normality. <p> The unusual pervades these stories, and Bloom handles some outsized events with delicacy and humor. In "Sleepwalking," a new widow sends her stepson away after they've slept together, because she wants him to have a normal life. The author makes us aware that there's something terrible and foolhardy about this woman's decision. Several other characters find themselves in equally desperate situations, their only consolation being recollections of earlier bliss, often sensual: "It was like nothing else in my life, that river of love that I could dip into and leave and return to once more and find it still flowing." For them, memories of past happiness makes present sorrow bearable.</p>Amy Bloom is the author of two novels, three collections of short stories, and a nominee for both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. She has written for The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, among many other publications, and has won a National Magazine Award. She lives in Connecticut and is Wesleyan University&#39;s Writer-in-Residence.</p><h2>Little Pischna (48 Practice Pieces): Schirmer Library of Classics Volume 898 Piano Solo</h2><p>A group of resourceful kids start solution-seekers.com, a website where cybervisitors can get answers to questions that trouble them.

This book&#x2032;s wise observations are as timeless as they are timely. "Short . . .succeeds in making theology enjoyable." --Christian Century ". . . a real delight from beginning to end. I could not possibly be more pleased." --Charles Schulz, creator of Peanuts </p></p><p>Maybe you thought Snoopy was a beagle. Turns out he's actually a Christ symbol, according to Robert L. Short's ingenious book, <i>Parables of Peanuts</i>. Cartoonist Charles Schulz, a devout Christian, once asked, "If we are all members of the priesthood, why cannot a cartoonist preach in the same manner as a minister, or anyone else?" This book explains that many of Schulz's cartoon strips, like Jesus' parables, combine "the proclamation of God's love for the world, and [depiction of] the world as it really is." <i>Parables</i> reproduces many classic Peanuts strips, including some rare early Red Baron strips. The illustrations are accompanied by some fairly heavy interpretations, laying out the basics of a conservative Reformed Protestant view of the gospel, with extensive references to theologians such as Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and Soren Kierkegaard. Although entertaining and engaging, <i>Parables of Peanuts</i> is not kids' stuff. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>Robert L. Short has been writing and lecturing on Charles Schulz's Peanuts cartoon strips and the gospel for more than forty years. He is the author of the huge bestsellers <em>The Gospel According to Peanuts</em> and <em>The Parables of Peanuts</em>. An ordained minister and a widely traveled speaker in theology and the arts, Short was a close friend of Charles Schulz and holds graduate degrees in theology and literature from S.M.U., North Texas University, and the University of Chicago Divinity School.</p></p><h2>The Portable Essential Oils: A Pocket Reference of Everyday Remedies for Natural Health &amp; Wellness</h2><p><p><strong> Everyday ailments have a way of sneaking up on us.

And when you carry out the exercises provided, you will be able to communicate freely with both your guardian angels and spirit guides.</p></p><p>For as long as humans have had writing, and probably long before that people have shared tales of non-material beings, both spirits of this world and angels from the spiritual realms. Now, the truth is, you can find a little bit about one or the other in a wide variety of books. But these days I'm into the idea of making things easier. So now there's no reason to go looking through numerous books when you can find all of the information you need in <i>Spirit Guides &amp; Angel Guardians</i> by Richard Webster. <br> <br>If you have ever puzzled about the meanings of these terms, this book is for you. You will find the history of spirits and angels and how they are different. You'll also learn how one angel is different from another and that there are different types of spirit guides. And of course, you'll learn how to contact them. <br> <br>Did you know that your attitudes and emotions can impede your communication with spirits and angels? It's true. And in this book you'll learn ways of improving your self-image and confidence while overcoming negative emotions such as greed and anger. Not only will you be better as a result, but you will be able to contact the non-physical entities more easily. <br> <br>The book reveals the secrets of becoming a medium to contact spirits. You'll also learn how to work with another person and with a group. You'll even learn how to communicate with spirits through table tipping, an easy skill to learn and one which will surprise and shock people who are watching as well as those who are participating. <br> <br>I just can't recommend this book more highly. It simply is the best starting point for learning about, and how to communicate and work with, spirits and angels.

On December 7th, when the attack on Pearl Harbor woke so many others to the reality of war, Stewart was already in uniform - as a private on guard duty south of San Francisco at the Army Air Corps Moffet Field. Seeing war on the horizon, Jimmy Stewart, at the height of his fame after <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> and his Oscar-winning turn in&nbsp;<i>The Phadelphia Story</i> in 1940<i>,</i>&nbsp;had enlisted several months earlier. <br><br><i>Jimmy Stewart, Bomber Pilot</i> chronicles his long journey to become a bomber pilot in combat. Author Starr Smith, the intelligence officer assigned to the movie star, recounts how Stewart's first battles were with the Air Corps high command, who insisted on keeping the naturally talented pilot out of harm's way as an instructor pilot for B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators. By 1944, however, Stewart managed to get assigned to a Liberator squadron that was deploying to England to join the mighty Eighth Air Force. Once in the thick of it, he rose to command his own squadron and flew twenty combat missions, including one to Berlin. <br>&#x201c;My father would feel honored by this book.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kelly Stewart Harcourt, daughter of Jimmy Stewart <br> "We would have made Jimmy a group commander [equivalent to an army regiment] if the war had lasted another month." - General Jimmy Doolittle. <br><br> "An excellent biography of a distinguished airman and fine human being." - Roger Freeman, author of <i>The Mighty Eighth: A History of the U.S. 8th Air Force</i>. <br><br> "How wonderful it is that Starr Smith has finally directed a literary light on the personal history of Jimmy Stewart. . . .

In addition to being America's first poet, she was also, in great likelihood, the first professional woman poet in the English language.<br>This collection of poetry, selected from a number of her works, discloses the thoughts of a remarkably sensitive and well-educated woman. Exhibiting great range and beauty, the poems encompass everything from lyric verses addressed to her husband and children and a formal elegy in honor of Queen Elizabeth I to loving epitaphs honoring her deceased mother, father, and grandchildren. <br>Grouped according to category (love, home life, religious meditations, dialogues, and lamentations), the poems not only exhibit Anne Bradstreet&#x2019;s wide learning but also reveal the influence of Montaigne, Homer, Raleigh, Sidney, Spenser, and other poets.

Sheen had for his dear St. Therese of Lisieux, his &#x201c;Little Flower&#x201d;.</p><p>Because of this intimacy and the unfathomable admiration he had for her, what lies between these pages is nothing short of remarkable, not to mention utterly captivating. Readers will find themselves moved in various ways, many of them unexpected. They will cry penitential tears, quake with happy laughter, shake their heads in disbelief, and experience an unquenchable yearning to imitate and experience the sort of closeness that both Sheen and Therese had with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The archbishop helps us realize just why St. Therese really is the &#x201c;greatest saint of modern times,&#x201d; and is among the greatest theologians the Church has ever produced. Using her example, he also explains the power of intercessory prayer, the necessity of virtue, how to put our suffering to good use, how to fight Satan&#x2019;s influence, and how to grow in our relationship with God and our love for one another.</p><p>In short, by reading this book, you will learn how to&nbsp;<i>be a saint from a saint</i>.&nbsp; Dive into this story of a love and see for yourself how it will develop the story of a soul...your own.</p></p><p>The life and teachings of Venerable Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen anticipated and embodied the spirit of both the Second Vatican Council and the New Evangelization. A gifted orator and writer, he was a pioneer in the use of media for evangelization: His radio and television broadcasts reached an estimated 30 million weekly viewers. He also wrote more than 60 works on Christian living and theology, many of which are still in print. Born in 1895, Sheen grew up in Peoria, Illinois, and was ordained a priest for the diocese in 1919. He was ordained an auxiliary bishop in New York City in 1951. As the head of his mission agency, the Society for the Propagation of the Faith (1950 1966), and as Bishop of Rochester (1966-1969), Sheen helped create 9,000 clinics, 10,000 orphanages, and 1,200 schools; and his contributions educated 80,000 seminarians and 9,000 religious. Upon his death in 1979, Sheen was buried at St. Patrick&#39;s Cathedral in New York. His cause for canonization was returned to his home diocese of Peoria in January 2011, and Sheen was proclaimed &#34;Venerable&#34; by Pope Benedict XVI on June 28, 2012. The first miracle attributed to his intercession was approved in March 2014, paving the way for his beatification.<p><i>&#x201c;These sermons by Bishop Sheen represent a life long study of the spirituality of St. Therese&nbsp; and are among the most inspiring of his works. There are many new insights into the much studied life of the saint but also into the spiritual life of this apostle of the media. The reader will be profoundly rewarded.&#x201d;</i></p><p>- &nbsp;Fr. Benedict Groeschel, CFR&nbsp;</p><br><br><p><i>&#x201c;During these trying days, saints are not only needed, they are necessary.

Theoretically, of course. A female Secret Service agent wants Reacher to find the holes in her system, and fast&#x2014;because a covert group already has the vice president in their sights. They&#x2019;ve planned well. There&#x2019;s just one thing they didn&#x2019;t plan on: Reacher.</p><p>What better way to test the security surrounding a U.S. vice president-elect than to hire someone skilled in the killing arts to penetrate his protection? Assassination strategy, though, is only part of the assignment facing Jack Reacher in <i>Without Fail</i>. This restive, blunt-edged ex-military cop must also determine whether recent threats against VP-to-be Senator Brook Armstrong are legitimate or are primarily intended to embarrass the perfectionist head of Armstrong's new Secret Service detail, M.E. Froelich, who happens to have been a girlfriend of Reacher's late brother.<p> If <i>Without Fail</i> lacks the emotional urgency of Lee Child's previous novel, <i>Echo Burning</i>, it still barely lets the reader catch a decent breath between plot crests. Jack and his fetching yet formidable colleague, Frances Neagley, must figure out how warning letters to Armstrong are being delivered into the Secret Service sanctum, whether the senator is at risk because of something political or personal, and who staged the demonstration murders of two innocent men also named Armstrong, first initial <i>B</i>. Unfortunately, a few twists (including the source of a thumbprint applied to the threats against Armstrong) can be figured out in advance, and the story is light on character development. A tiny breach in Reacher's reclusive carapace opens as Froelich transfers the love she once felt for his brother toward him, and there are suggestions that Neagley may have depths of feeling just waiting to be plumbed. However, other players are mere ciphers--the sacrificial victims of an action-oriented yarn. <i>--J.

She grew up in Newton, MA. Linda's other published works include <i>Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters</i> and <i>Between Two Worlds: Young Women in Crisis</i>.Sexton claimed that poetry kept her alive through periods of suicidal self-hatred, and indeed her poetry started as therapy, a means suggested by her psychiatrist of documenting the unspeakable. This volume contains selections, many of them familiar, from her eight books. Despite professional success, she continued to suffer, but her work does more than document the pain that finally led to alcohol addiction and suicide. Labeled confessional, she preferred to be called a storyteller, often adopting a persona: "Like Oedipus I am losing my sight./Like Judas I have done my wrong." Much of the early poetry was workshop-influenced, but Sexton's music as well as her intensity and good ear ultimately come through.

Velte Associate Professor of Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, National Defense University, and Associate, Washington Center for Protocol, Inc.</b><br><br>This latest edition of <em>Understanding Arabs</em> is a great introduction to the Arab world for both the general public and college students who wish to expand their knowledge of the region. Nydell's book is of tremendous use in the classroom, as it engages the cultural, linguistic, religious and political diversity of the Arab people and the Arab lands.&#x2015;<b>Douja Mariem Mamelouk, Assistant Professor, French and Arabic Literatures, University of Tennessee, Knoxville</b><br><br>Still the only volume of its kind. This timely and needed volume supports serious-minded efforts to learn, understand, and communicate with Arabs and Muslims. Nydell combines her many years of experience living in the region with her special linguistic expertise to offer today's students insights they are obliged to critically consider before study or research abroad. The accessible presentation succeeds in humanizing as it reveals both the difficult issues and the abiding values that govern people's experiences. Nydell reminds us that in the Middle East and North Africa there will be much more to grasp as continued rapid change alters those lives daily.&#x2015;<b>Terrence M. Potter, Visiting Associate Professor, Georgetown University</b><br><br>This book is a must-read for anyone wanting to comprehend the Middle East. The writing is fluid, full of examples, and updated to include the Arab Spring. Dr. Nydell, a world renowned linguist with decades of practical experience in the field, is an authoritative voice. She provides profound insights into Arabs' perceptions underlying political events, and our interactions with each other.&#x2015;<b>Elizabeth McKune, Executive Director, Sultan Qaboos Cultural Center, and Former US Ambassador to the State of Qatar</b><br><br>This is an important and fascinating book, especially for Americans in the crucial time in U.S.-Arab relations. Dr. Nydell presents a timely, lucid, and engaging guide to the values and cultures of the Arab world, based on her many years of working and living there, and on her training as a professional linguist. This candid and wonderfully readable book captures the contrasts and the characteristics of this great civilization and brings them vividly to life for a Western audience.&#x2015;<b>Karin Ryding, PhD, Sultan Qaboos bin Said Professor of Arabic, and Chair of the Department of Arabic Language, Georgetown University</b><br><br>Middle East specialists have long relied on their worn copies of Understanding Arabs for insights about Arab social behaviour.. A whole generation of U.S. diplomats were introduced to the subject by Dr. Nydell in the 1970s and 1980s.

Or perhaps as Merry Gentry, Los Angeles private eye. To protect my unborn children, I have turned my back on the crown, choosing exile in the human world with my beloved Frost and Darkness. Yet I cannot abandon my people. Someone is killing the fey, which has left the LAPD baffled and my guardsmen and me deeply disturbed. I thought I&#x2019;d left the blood and politics behind in my own turbulent realm. But now I realize that evil knows no borders, and that nobody lives forever&#x2014;even if they&#x2019;re magical.</p><p><strong>Laurell K. Hamilton on <i>Divine Misdemeanors</i></strong> <br> <p> </p><p>Meredith Gentry was created as a character so that my muse and I could have a break from writing the Anita Blake series. I&#x2019;d written five Anita books in a row and was starting to have job anxiety dreams about her life instead of mine. I needed something different for my muse and me to play with. Merry was created to give me a different voice, a different world to visit. I guess she&#x2019;s like a second child that you have so the first one won&#x2019;t be an only. Then, like a parent that just didn&#x2019;t understand that a second child doesn&#x2019;t double your workload, but quadruples it, I was suddenly trying to do two different series at two different publishers. It went well since they&#x2019;re both <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. The audience for both crosses nicely and continues to grow with every book in a time when very few authors can say that. So it&#x2019;s all good, but just like trying to juggle two kids instead of one, juggling two book series instead of just one presents its challenges.</p> <p>At the beginning keeping Anita&#x2019;s voice out of the Merry books was the biggest challenge. I was used to her, and her voice and attitude were closer to my own, so Anita wrote faster, clearer in my head. Merry was that second baby that is nothing like your first baby, so most of what you learned about taking care of character A doesn&#x2019;t help a damn bit with character B. Who knew? But there comes a point when you make peace with the second child being so different from the first and so different from yourself. You find the unique joys in that second person, as I&#x2019;ve found the joys in the Merry series that are different from Anita. </p> <p>Anita fights me on paper and always has. She&#x2019;s very much my rebel. Merry never fought on paper until the last book, <i>Swallowing Darkness</i>, and then she found things worth fighting for. She finally stood up and told me what she wanted and she was willing to do whatever it took to get there. I understood that. I let Merry&#x2019;s desires, loves, and choices change where I had planned to end the first cycle of the series. Anita has thrown out entire last thirds of books by her choices, and even scrapped entire novel ideas because she&#x2019;d simply grown in a different direction. If I did that for my oldest creation, how could I not do the same for my youngest creation?</p> <p>In fact, Merry found her voice so pure and clear that on the last two Anita Blake novels I&#x2019;ve had to chase her out of my head so Anita could be loud. Now the biggest challenge is balancing the writing schedule between two bestselling series, two different publishers, and that thing called a real life. Doing justice to my two imaginary worlds, and still managing to have a life in the real world... that&#x2019;s the true challenge.<i>--Laurell K. Hamilton</i></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Laurell K.

Puritan pastor Richard Baxter spent most of his ministry caring for depressed and discouraged souls, and his timeless counsel still speaks to us today. In this book, psychiatrist Michael S. Lundy and theologian J. I. Packer present Baxter&#x2019;s writings in order to comfort, instruct, and strengthen all who struggle with depression.</p></p><p><p><strong>J. I. Packer</strong> (DPhil, Oxford University) serves as the Board of Governors&#x2019; Professor of Theology at Regent College. He is the author of numerous books, including the classic best-seller <em>Knowing God</em>. Packer served as general editor for the English Standard Version Bible and as theological editor for the <em>ESV Study Bible.</em></p><p>Board of Governors' Professor of Theology, Regent College</p><p>&#x201c;Richard Baxter was a skilled psychologist as well as a theologian. In this book are some of his writings on depression. J. I. Packer is a modern theologian and lifelong student of Baxter. Michael Lundy is a clinical psychiatrist who has modernized the texts of Baxter. The result is an unusually instructive book of practical wisdom that will be a great help to pastors and others who are called to give counsel to the downcast.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Paul Helm,</strong> Professor of Theology and Religious Studies Emeritus, King&#x2019;s College, London</p><p>&#x201c;Here you will find two treasures for the price of one: consultations with a practicing psychiatrist (Michael Lundy&#x2015;who, by definition, is a &#x2018;healer of the soul&#x2019;) and a distinguished theologian (J. I. Packer&#x2015;who especially loves authors whose theology engages what used to be called &#x2018;the cure of souls&#x2019;). But, in fact, it turns out to be three treasures for the price of one, as a doctor of medicine and a doctor of philosophy together highlight the wisdom of the remarkable pastor-theologian Richard Baxter. <i>Depression, Anxiety, and the Christian Life</i> is simultaneously a manual for pastors and counselors, a resource for study groups, and a thesaurus of wise spiritual counsel for those who struggle and for those who care about them. A few consultations with the soul-physician group of Packer, Lundy, and Baxter will be medicine for your soul!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sinclair B.

In this book, J. I. Packer and Michael Lundy team up with the great Puritan Richard Baxter, who was truly a physician of souls, to offer Christians much-needed help on the thorny spiritual realities of depression and anxiety. Few, if any, Christians are unfamiliar with the pain of anxiety and depression. Few, if any, will fail to be immensely helped by the guidance offered in these pages.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mark Jones,</strong> Teaching Elder, Faith Vancouver Presbyterian Church, Vancouver, British Columbia</p></p><h2>Messages from Michael; 25th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>Twenty-five years ago, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro and her friends began sharing messages from a group entity that called themselves &#34;Michael.&#34; Michael&#39;s words were offered without alteration or interpretation for seekers, students, and skeptics alike. Pragmatic, insightful, and often witty, Michael insisted their work was simply to help questioners become more aware and better able to make their own decisions in life. Through this initial volume, Messages From Michael, and three more that followed, Michael spoke to thousands who found new understandings of themselves. Unfortunately imitators and frauds have since exploited the Michael teachings-but even they admit that Messages From Michael was the first source of the teachings.

Kennedy.</strong></p><p><em>The Making of the President: 1960</em> revolutionized the way modern presidential campaigns are reported. Reporting from within the campaign for the first time on record, White&#x2019;s extensive research and access to all parties involved set the bar for campaign coverage and remains unparalleled. White conveyed, in magnificent detail and with exquisite pacing, the high-stakes drama; he painted the unforgettable, even mythic, story of JFK versus Nixon; and most of all, he imbued the nation&#x2019;s presidential election process with a grandeur that later political writers have rarely matched. </p></p><p>Students of politics and political reporting should cheer: This too- long-out-of-print classic is coming back. The book and the campaign it covered are throwbacks to an era more and more citizens, increasingly mired in sound-bites and tabloidism, are at least subconsciously desperate to resuscitate. You&#39;ll be amazed at how knowledgeable (and sometimes even wise) both White and the candidates he covers--Kennedy and Nixon--seem.

Will states with the largest, best equipped, information-technology-rich militaries invariably win? The prevailing answer today among both scholars and policymakers is yes. But this is to overlook force employment, or the doctrine and tactics by which materiel is actually used. In a landmark reconception of battle and war, this book provides a systematic account of how force employment interacts with materiel to produce real combat outcomes. Stephen Biddle argues that force employment is central to modern war, becoming increasingly important since 1900 as the key to surviving ever more lethal weaponry. Technological change produces opposite effects depending on how forces are employed; to focus only on materiel is thus to risk major error--with serious consequences for both policy and scholarship.</p><br><p> In clear, fluent prose, Biddle provides a systematic account of force employment's role and shows how this account holds up under rigorous, multimethod testing. The results challenge a wide variety of standard views, from current expectations for a revolution in military affairs to mainstream scholarship in international relations and orthodox interpretations of modern military history.</p><br><br><p> <i>Military Power</i> will have a resounding impact on both scholarship in the field and on policy debates over the future of warfare, the size of the military, and the makeup of the defense budget.</p></p><p><p>"Stephen Biddle's <i>Military Power</i> is one of the most important contributions to strategic studies in recent decades. Presenting a very powerful case for a very surprising argument on a very important question, it will be controversial in some quarters, but critics will be hard-pressed to refute the case."<b>--Richard K. Betts, Columbia University, author of <i>Military Readiness</i></b></p><p>"Fascinating, precisely written, indeed, brilliant, <i>Military Power</i> is among the most important books ever published on modern warfare. Stephen Biddle fundamentally rethinks the causes of victory and defeat in modern war and challenges almost the entire corpus of scholarship on assessing force capability and the role of offense and defense in determining war outcomes. Presenting his argument with power, balance, and subtlety, he synthesizes many partial historical explanations and provides a basis for understanding why so many 'rules of thumb' and other explanations are misleading. A landmark work."<b>--Lynn Eden, Stanford University, author of <i>Whole World on Fire</i></b></p><p>"Steve Biddle may be the best American defense analyst of his generation, and this book is quite possibly his career masterpiece to date. Few are as well qualified as Biddle to weave together vivid descriptions of the modern battlefield, clear explanations of historical lessons, a detailed understanding of defense technology, and a sophisticated use of military models and war games. Biddle does all these things, helping the reader understand modern warfare more than does any other book on the market. His argument about trends in warfare transcends the popular theory that a revolution in military affairs is now underway. He replaces this theory with a more convincing, more historical, and less technology-obsessed view of the modern battlefield."<b>--Michael O'Hanlon, Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution</b></p><b>Stephen Biddle</b> is Senior Fellow in Defense Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. He has published extensively in defense policy and international relations, and he has held teaching and research positions in both academic political science and official defense policy analysis.</p><h2>The Ruby Programming Language: Everything You Need to Know</h2><p><p><em>The Ruby Programming Language</em> is <em>the</em> authoritative guide to Ruby and provides comprehensive coverage of versions 1.8 and 1.9 of the language.

His book is written with panache. The style is brisk, the content stimulating. I recommend it as a bracing experience." -NEW SCIENTIST</p><p>. . . In print, at least, what might seem arrogant comes across as a kind of innocent, childlike enthusiasm, a lack of concern for anything but the sheer joy of figuring things out. His ruthless simplifications of geology, evolution, and neurology pay off because, as Bak notes, his models describe behavior that is common across these domains. This universality means that trampling across others&#39; turf is not only acceptable, but almost mandatory, if the underlying principles are to be exposed. Finally, for the most part, Bak wants the reader to grasp the basic logic of his arguments; only rarely does he try to persuade with flights of poetic language or brute intellectual authority.Per Bak is a professor in the Physics Department of Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Entering a room with stainless-steel tables topped by corpses in body bags was initially unnerving. But once Montross met her cadaver, she found herself intrigued by the person the woman once was and fascinated by the strange, unsettling beauty of the human form. They called her Eve. The story of Montross and Eve is a tender and surprising examination of the mysteries of the human body, and a remarkable look at our relationship with both the living and the dead.</p><p><b>CHRISTINE MONTROSS</b> is a resident of psychiatry at Brown University. She received her MFA in poetry from the University of Michigan.BODY OF WORK is Christine Montrosss memoir of her first year in medical school, during which she studied human anatomy with the help of Eve an elderly woman who donated her remains for that purpose. Thoroughly and methodically dissecting a human cadaver is an experience that includes equal parts revulsion, fascination, empathy, and indifference. Rene Raudman touches on each of these in all the appropriate places, and with just the right level of emotion. Her tone, like Montrosss writing, is often irreverent and dryly funny, without ever being disrespectful. The author interview at the end gives an added glimpse into the anatomy lab.

Paton contains everything necessary to make it a missionary classic. Born into a Christian family near Dumfries in 1824, Paton&#39;s early years were marked by a struggle against poverty. He was self-educated, and the training ground for his life&#39;s work was the slums of Glasgow where he laboured with success as a city missionary. With &#39;the wail of the perishing heathen in the South Seas&#39; continually sounding in his ears, he prepared himself to serve overseas and was ordained as a missionary to the New Hebrides in 1858. This gorup of thirty mountainous islands, so named by Captain Cook, with its unhealthy climate, was then inhabited by savages and cannibals. The first attempt to introduce Christianity to them resulted in John Williams and James Harris being clubbed to death of his wife and child within months of their arrival. Against the savagery and the superstition, despite the trials and the tragedies, Paton persevered and witnessed the triumph of the gospel in two of these South Sea islands. His life is almost without parallel in missionary annals and his account of it is moving and gripping.</p><p>The material which John G Paton had collected over the years were compiled and edited by his brother Rev James Paton who supported John Paton in Scotland. Rev Paton was an author and Presbyterian minister in Scotland.</p><h2>Grow 15 Herbs for the Kitchen: Storey&#39;s Country Wisdom Bulletin A-61 (Storey Country Wisdom Bulletin)</h2><p>No kitchen should be without these fifteen beautiful, versatile, aromatic, and savory wonders of the culinary world.

For readers who have wondered, this is an outstanding introduction. Arnosky provides a brief, informative text and beautiful, detailed full-color paintings with enormous appeal. He describes freshwater, salt water, and land-dwelling turtles, showing the differences in shell structure, patterns, anatomy, habitat, eggs, and diet. Only common names are given for the species illustrated, but many will be familiar. For example, freshwater turtles include the cooter, spotted, and painted turtles, while sea turtles depicted are the loggerhead, leatherback, and softshell. The author does not include size or range information. When specialized scientific language is used, the carefully placed drawings make clear what the author refers to. For example, drawings show the upper and lower turtle shell and are labeled ``carapace'' and ``plastron.'' There are also side views to help the reader tell a female turtle with convex plastron and the male turtle with concave plastron. Part of the ``All About'' series, this is an unusually appealing title by a fine science artist and author. Recommended with enthusiasm. (Nonfiction. 7-10)-- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 1-4-As in the previous titles in this series, Arnosky draws on his personal experiences and observations to share his fascination for the natural world with children. The realistic, colorful illustrations depict a wide variety of turtles, from the massive marine leatherbacks to the land-loving box turtle and the familiar painted turtle of freshwater ponds. This visual feast is accompanied by a simple text describing turtle physiology, habitats, lifestyles, and reproduction. An unfortunate lapse, however, is that there is no scale to indicate size comparison, which may confuse children not up on turtle physiology. Team this with Melvin Berger's less elegant (but still attractive) Look Out for Turtles!

Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Eliphas Levi, born Alphonse Louis Constant, was a French occult author and ceremonial magician. Levi&#39;s version of magic became a great success, especially after his death. That Spiritualism was popular on both sides of the Atlantic from the 1850s contributed to this success. His magical teachings were free from obvious fanaticisms; he had nothing to sell, and did not pretend to be the initiate of some ancient or fictitious secret society. He incorporated the Tarot cards into his magical system, and as a result the Tarot has been an important part of the paraphernalia of Western magicians. He had a deep impact on the magic of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and later on the ex-Golden Dawn member Aleister Crowley. He was also the first to declare that a pentagram or five-pointed star with one point down and two points up represents evil, while a pentagram with one point up and two points down represents good. It was largely through the occultists inspired by him that Levi is remembered as one of the key founders of the 20th century revival of magic.</p><p></p><h2>For Young Men Only: A Guy&#39;s Guide to the Alien Gender</h2><p><b>Just for guys...the inside scoop on girls from the girls themselves.<br></b><br>Okay, the authors aren't girls.

(Okay, sometimes we don&#x2019;t think at all, but let&#x2019;s not go there.) Shaunti realized that even though she loved someone as smooth as me, she simply didn&#x2019;t get a lot about me.

In fact, she talked to men and women from all over who had simply given up on thinking that you <i>could </i>understand someone of the opposite sex, even one you loved very much. That realization prompted her to launch a research project that asked men how they really felt about certain topics. Especially about some of the more hidden, difficult, and important aspects of being a man. Their answers led Shaunti to write <i>For Women Only: What</i> <i>You Need to know about the inner lives of men.</i><br><br>It became a national bestseller.

And women everywhere realized they could know and love their man for who he really was, not for who they thought he was. We&#x2019;re still amazed at how often just one new insight about the opposite sex can turn a light bulb on over our heads&#x2013;and turn a relationship completely around.<br><br>Other bestsellers in the series followed, including <i>For Men Only </i>and <i>For Young Women Only. </i>Each of them uses a carefully designed,<i> </i>nationally representative scientific survey to help one gender understand<i> </i>what goes on inside the heads of the other.<i><br></i><br>Which brings us to <i>FYMO.<br></i><br>Honestly, we delayed bringing out this installment in the series as long as possible. Would your average teen guy read a book about how girls think? Watch a YouTube clip maybe. Or wait for the manga version. But actually read a carefully researched book about how to figure out and relate to girls? We weren&#x2019;t sure.<br><br>At first it was just worried parents and about a million teen girls who asked us to write this book. Parents said things like, &#x201c;Our darling son seems somewhat, oh, challenged around the opposite, you know, s-s-sex.&#x201d; Girls said things like, &#x201c;Boys are just stupid.&#x201d;<br><br>Then teen guys themselves started asking. After the hundredth high schooler told us he wished there were a &#x201c;chick manual&#x201d; for ordinary guys, we decided to go for it.<br><br><b>Our No-Rehash Promise<br></b><br>Shaunti and I (Jeff) enlisted my best buddy, Eric Rice (the husband of Lisa, Shaunti&#x2019;s coauthor on <i>For Young Women Only</i>), to help me write this book. Being a talented screenwriter and director, Eric makes the perfect coauthor. Also, he&#x2019;s father to three of the smartest, most attractive teen girls we know. Also, he&#x2019;s insane. (Maybe it&#x2019;s the teenage daughters.)<br><br>To make sure we were asking the right questions, Eric and I started with some things we never understood about girls when we were in high school. Then we set up focus groups with dozens of Atlanta-area teenage girls. With Lisa and Shaunti helping to host the groups (so the girls felt they could talk safely and candidly), we started to identify important problem areas to cover.<br><br>Interesting questions came naturally to our team. Lisa is a journalist, Shaunti is a relationship analyst, I&#x2019;m a lawyer, and Eric is crazy.<br><br>To every potential topic we applied one important test: would it be a big surprise for today&#x2019;s teenage guys? If not, we weren&#x2019;t interested. We didn&#x2019;t want to rehash the obvious stuff. We didn&#x2019;t want to preach. We just wanted to go for those shockers that most guys wouldn&#x2019;t believe&#x2013;but that were true...and were true for most girls, no matter their ethnic or religious backgrounds, no matter where they live or what kind of cars their families drive.<br><br>Next, Shaunti and Lisa hit the malls around Atlanta to ask questions of hundreds of teens. And since they regularly travel and speak around the country, they also randomly interviewed any teenage girls they came across (&#x201c;So, Courtney, what would you be thinking if a guy said <i>this</i>...?&#x201d;).<br><br>Finally, we took what we were hearing informally and tested it with an expensive, scientific, nationally representative survey of more than four hundred girls, conducted by the highly regarded firm Decision Analyst. If we were going to claim that girls really did think a certain way, then an official, expensive national survey had to confirm it. (Did we mention it was expensive?)<br><br>After we analyzed the survey results, we boiled down all the subjects on which most girls agreed and came up with these six lightbulb-over-the-head insights.<br><br>And that&#x2019;s how this journey into the adolescent female brain came to be. In the end, more than one thousand girls provided input for this book. What we&#x2019;re bringing you, therefore, is not our opinion. (In some cases the research directly contradicted our opinion!) Instead, what we&#x2019;re bringing you are the heartfelt thoughts of the girls themselves.<br><br><b>Read This or You&#x2019;ll Explode<br></b><br>Before you begin your quest through the rest of the book, note these important points:<br><br>� <i>FYMO </i>was written weird but well. Eric and I wrote it, with a lot of help from Shaunti and Lisa and some more help from our impossible-to-please editor, David Kopp. When you read &#x201c;we&#x201d; in this book, usually it means Jeff and Eric. But sometimes it means all long-suffering males (that would include you). When you read &#x201c;I (Eric)&#x201d; or &#x201c;I (Jeff ),&#x201d; don&#x2019;t get alarmed. You don&#x2019;t have an author with multiple personality disorder. It just means one of us doesn&#x2019;t want the other guy to get credit for the amazing insight or funny story that follows.<br><br>� We&#x2019;re focusing only on what you need to know about girls but probably don&#x2019;t. We don&#x2019;t deal at all with what girls should know about you or other young male humanoids. If you want to find that out, sneak off with your girlfriend&#x2019;s copy of <i>For Young Women Only.</i><br><br>� We present our survey results with confidence. But when we report that &#x201c;most girls&#x201d; think a certain way, remember that <i>most </i>means &#x201c;most,&#x201d; not &#x201c;all.&#x201d; There are exceptions to every rule, and you probably know one. To read the entire survey, go to foryoungmenonlybook.com.<br><br>� Our survey describes what girls <i>say </i>they think or want when it comes to guys, not what we believe they <i>should </i>think or want. We sometimes found ourselves wishing the truth were different. But that&#x2019;s the point of this book: the truth about how girls really think. Even when it&#x2019;s surprising or hard to hear.<br><br>� We approach life as Christians. This book describes what is going on inside teenage girls regardless of race, culture, or religion, and it outlines <i>their </i>advice for what guys can do to best relate to them. But in the parts of the book where <i>we</i> give advice, our convictions (like &#x201c;the Bible is right&#x201d;) are just going to leak out. We hope you understand.<br><br>� If you&#x2019;re looking for a book that pulls together biblical &#x201c;rules&#x201d; for dating, there are plenty of good ones out there. But <i>FYMO </i>isn&#x2019;t one of them. This is a short book, and in our limited space, our only focus is the honest truth about how girls are wired and how you can apply that to your relationships. (You can find pointers to other great resources at www.foryoungmenonly.com. You might start with <i>Boy</i> <i>Meets Girl </i>and other Joshua Harris books.)<br><br>� To help you and your friends get even more out of the book, we&#x2019;ve included a short small-group discussion guide at the back of this book.<br><br><b>Confidence: The New Superpower<br></b><br>You may not realize it yet, but for the price of this book, we are handing you a silver platter of wisdom that will help you navigate the challenges of the alien gender with confidence&#x2013;the confidence that comes from realizing that you actually understand what is going on around you. You will come away with a whole arsenal of new insights. You will move from the average &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really get girls&#x201d; guy to someone with superpowers. You will basically have a master&#x2019;s degree in Girl.<br><br>We challenge you to use these powers wisely and not for your own selfish purposes. If we hear that you haven&#x2019;t used your new knowledge well, we will hunt you down and force you to sit through our twelve-hour two-on-one seminar. And we&#x2019;ll charge you for it. <br><br>You ready for the adventure? Sit back for a fun ride and plenty of big&#x2013;and amazingly helpful&#x2013;surprises about how girls think.

That was rare, even for early March; the little SoCal city usually boasted blue skies year-round. But the clouds had rolled in off the ocean, and now raindrops pattered across the houses of rich and poor alike, the one great equalizer in a town without a middle class.<br> &nbsp;<br> A grimy white van trolled slowly through the east edge of town, where Zen landscaping gave way to weed-strewn lots. There were no millionaires&#x2019; homes here&#x2014;no boutiques, no surf shops, no post-op resorts for wealthy nip/tuck patients. Out here were prefab houses propped on cinderblocks, biker bars, chop shops. The buildings were all sun-bleached and dingy, the roads speckled with potholes that sent the van bucking on its worn-out shocks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Frank Kozlowski was a junk dealer, just like his old man had been. His late wife always liked to say he was in &#x201c;antiques,&#x201d; but ninety percent of what he found was well and truly junk&#x2014;broken appliances he stripped for parts, scrap metal he recycled at a buck a pound. But every so often he found something really good. In a town like Neptune, where the wealthy always had more than they knew what to do with, a guy with wheels and initiative could make out like a bandit. High-end furniture that just needed reupholstery or refinishing; designer clothes with minor stains and tears. Paint-by-numbers art, antique road signs, and metal lunch boxes with &#x2019;70s-era cartoon characters on the front. He salvaged the best of it and resold it from his garage, mostly to young, Tyrolean-hatted guys and buzz-cut girls in resale mom jeans who used words like &#x201c;naive&#x201d; and &#x201c;authentic&#x201d; to describe his wares. Kozlowski didn&#x2019;t mind&#x2014;or in most cases even notice&#x2014;the affectation. These kids kept the mortgage paid and the fridge stocked with beer.<br> &nbsp;<br> He drove slowly through the rain, alert for any kind of glimmer from the underbrush. A rosary swayed back and forth from his rearview mirror, almost in time with the wipers. In the passenger seat, his little wire-haired mutt, Gus, sat at attention, ears pricked forward. It was just after seven a.m. and he&#x2019;d already been out here for two hours. So far all he&#x2019;d found was a stack of warped two-by-fours, a brass drawer pull, and a molded plastic chair pocked with cigarette-burn stigmata.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the business was like that. Some mornings were a bust. Other mornings, the junk fairy lit a path at your feet and led you to something special. That&#x2019;s what really got him out of bed at four in the dark, cold-ass morning. Not so much the promise of cash as that into-the-red spike of adrenaline, the thrill of the next big find. The way a single magic discovery could vindicate a hundred shitty, wasted trips. He&#x2019;d never been able to explain that to Nell. She always groaned when he came back with rusted, filthy roadside dross. &#x201c;Jesus, Frank, why can&#x2019;t you just hit up estate sales like everyone else? Flea markets. Thrift shops. This stuff is worthless.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Worthless. The word&#x2014;the very idea&#x2014;left him dumb-struck. Nothing was worthless. Not if you knew who needed it. Not if you knew how to salvage it. She&#x2019;d never really appreciated that.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, that road went both ways. He&#x2019;d been startled by the silence in the house in the year since she&#x2019;d died (emphysema; she&#x2019;d never been able to give up the fucking cigarettes), startled by how hard it was to sleep without her cold feet on his calves all night. They&#x2019;d never had any kids. Now it was just him and Gus and a restless, edgy energy that sent him pacing from room to room and woke him in the pre-dawn chill, hounding him out of the house and into the junkyards and abandoned buildings fringing Neptune. He never thought to call the feeling grief.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, cruising along the empty road, his mind drifted. He thought about the donuts he always picked up on the way home, and the hot shower he&#x2019;d take after unloading the shit from his van. Gus would need a bath too, after the rain and mud. He&#x2019;d just about decided to throw in the towel and head home when he saw it.<br> &nbsp;<br> There.<br> &nbsp;<br> He eased his van onto the shoulder and killed the engine. The road banked sharply downward toward a lot fringed with buckwheat and sumac, a scraggly patch of land with a faded for sale sign nailed to a post. The sign had been there at least a decade. This wasn&#x2019;t exactly prime real estate, situated on the edge of town in the empty miles between a ramshackle trailer park and the Balboa County Youth Correctional Compound. Half of Neptune seemed to use it as a cost-effective dumping ground, making it a regular stop on Kozlowski&#x2019;s circuit. He&#x2019;d found some good stuff in that lot over the years. A box of dog-eared Playboys. A six-foot fiberglass cheeseburger from a long-defunct drive-through. The front half of a &#x2019;68 Buick Skylark that he&#x2019;d sold to a restora-tion company. And now he&#x2019;d caught a glimpse of something through the gloom&#x2014;something that might just be worth stumbling down that bank for.<br><br> Gus jumped lightly out of the van and took off running, his tail flailing right and left. He loved the hunt as much as Kozlowski, sensing his master&#x2019;s excitement and feeding off it. Kozlowski stepped out after the dog, slamming the door behind him. Icy needles of rain stung his cheeks and neck. He hunched his shoulders against the cold, his boots sinking down in the mud. For a moment he couldn&#x2019;t see anything, and he wondered if he&#x2019;d imagined it. But then he found it again&#x2014;a dirty pink shape, half hidden in the sedge. A dress form, perhaps a mannequin? His heart gave the familiar little stutter that almost always meant a good score.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man knelt alongside Gus and patted the dog&#x2019;s trembling rump. &#x201c;What do you think? Worth getting wet for?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gus whipped around in a tight, fast little circle. That was good enough for Kozlowski.<br> &nbsp;<br> The incline was steep and slippery. He edged his way down, leaning back to keep from going ass-over-teakettle. Gus scampered ahead of him and then paused at the base of the hill, shaking water from his coat. Kozlowski&#x2019;s eyes locked in on the thing in the field. Definitely a mannequin&#x2014;he could see the arms and legs splayed out in the mud. Cleaned up and restored it might get him a C-note from a vintage shop or a tailor. And there was the outside chance it was worth real money. He&#x2019;d heard of antique mannequins going for seven, eight hundred a pop, sometimes more if it was a rare model in good condition.<br> &nbsp;<br> But even from fifty feet away, this one was looking pretty rough. Its wig was so tangled and dirty he couldn&#x2019;t guess what the original color might have been. The left arm crooked out at a strange angle to the rest of the body, probably busted. Dark streaks of mud wreathed the pale figure. Gus darted ahead across the field toward the thing, running in wild circles around it for a moment as Kozlowski approached.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was a few yards away when the hair on the back of his neck suddenly shot up. Something felt wrong about the whole scene. The mannequin&#x2019;s skintight dress was hiked up around its waist, its sculpted buttocks bare to the sky. Another time he might have thought it was funny, trying to imagine why the hell the manufacturers had designed a dress-store dummy with a realistic ass. But here in the rain, splayed out in the mud, it looked so sad&#x2014;so sick&#x2014;he felt a creeping unease that crowded out the dollar signs he&#x2019;d imagined.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gus was pawing at the thing&#x2019;s torso, a thin whine coming up from his throat. Through the sound of the rain, Kozlowski could hear the distant croak of a raven from the tree line around the lot. He stepped closer, barely noticing the dull throb in his knee or the cold weight of his soaked denim jacket, kneeling down next to the shattered form in the gorse.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two things happened at once.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first was that Kozlowski&#x2019;s eyes confirmed what some part of his gut already suspected: that the pale peach color was not fiberglass but flesh. That the dress was torn almost to shreds. That the black grime caking the skin was laced with streaks of dark red.<br> &nbsp;<br> The second was that the woman&#x2019;s left hand&#x2014;jutting at a grotesque angle from the rest of her body&#x2014;slowly clenched, fingers curling down into the dirt.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was still alive.</p><h2>Zentangle 8, Expanded Workbook Edition: Monograms, Alphabets, and 40 All-New Tangles (Design Originals) How to Embellish Letters, Monograms, Cards, Stationery, Gifts, and More with Beautiful Designs</h2><p><p>Elegant letters are the perfect way to personalize a greeting card, stationery or a memorable gift.

They use incestuous adulterie with spirits ... They eate the flesh and drinke the bloud of men and children openlie ... They kill mens cattell ... They bewitch mens corne ... They ride and flie in the aire, bring stormes, make tempests ... They use venerie with a divell called Incubus and have children by them, which become the best witches ...<br></i>In 1584, when there were few who would even defend witches against these charges, Reginald Scot went one step further. He actually set out to prove that witches did not and could not exist! King James later found Scot's opinion so heretical that he ordered all copies of his book to be burned. But so rich and full of data on the charges against witches, on witch trials and on the actual practice of the black arts was Scot's <i>Discoverie of Witchcraft</i> that it remained a much-used source throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and is still one of the few primary sources for the study of witchcraft today.<br>At the heart of Scot's book are stories and charges pulled from the writers of the Inquisition about the supposed nature of witches. Scot believed that the utter absurdity of the facts would be enough to stop belief in witchcraft forever. But he also goes on to give opinions of medical authorities, interviews with those convicted of witchcraft, and details about the two-faced practices of those in charge of the inquisitions to show even further why the charges of witchcraft were simply not true. In later chapters Scot details the other side of the question through a study of the black arts that are not purely imaginary. He discusses poisoners, jugglers, conjurers, charmers, soothsayers, figure-casters, dreamers, alchemists, and astrologers and, in turn, sets down the actual practices of each group and shows how the acts depend not upon the devil but upon either trickery or skill. In the process, many of the magician's secrets and much other folk and professional lore of the time is made available to the reader of today.<br>Shortly after the Spanish Inquisition, directly in the wake of Sprenger and Kramer's <i>Malleus Maleficarum, </i>during the great upsurge of witch trials in Britain, Scot was a direct witness to the witchmonger in one of witch-hunting's bloodiest eras. Whatever your interest in witchcraft &#x2014; either historical, psychological, or sympathetic &#x2014; Scot, in his disproof, tells you much more about the subject than the many, many contemporary writers on the other side of the question.</p><p></p><h2>The Gus (The Puppy Place)</h2><p><b>Welcome to the Puppy Place--where every puppy finds a home!</b><br><br>Charles and Lizzie Peterson love puppies.

The general public associates shamanism with the holy healing people of native tribes, while they associate witches with spells, potions, Halloween, and, due to popular misconceptions, evil. The two seem worlds apart, but in reality, they come from a very similar root. <br><b></b><b>What Is a Shaman? <br></b>The word shaman, or saman, is Tungus in origin, coming from the Ural-Altaic tribal people of Siberia. Related to the Tungus word <i>sa, </i>which translates as &#x201c;to know,&#x201d; the Siberian people use the word saman to refer to men and women who act as the spiritual healers and wise ones of the tribe. They are the ones who know the mysteries of spirit. The word shaman is properly used to refer to the spirit healers of those tribes who share a similar genetic origin to those of Siberia. It is usually used in reference to the healers of the North and South American tribes, but culturally and linguistically it can be used throughout Eurasia. <br>The role of the shaman applies to both men and women, though culturally one gender can be more prevalent than the other. Few refer to female shamans with a different word, such as shamaness. Sexual orientation and gender identity does not preclude one from shamanism either. In many traditions, shamans dress in the clothes of the opposite gender or practice homosexuality. <br>For anthropologists exploring the spiritualities of tribal societies, the word shaman is an easier and safer term than the words witch, wizard, sorcerer, magician, and seer, even though these labels were used in the past to describe the tribal shaman&#x2019;s European counterparts. For those from a Western mainstream academic background, shaman has less negative baggage than these other highly charged terms. <br>In an effort to be more precise, some anthropologists and mystical students use the term core shamanism to differentiate the use of shamanic techniques and ideas from traditional Siberian or Native shamanism. Although it is not a religion, shamanism has a definitive set of core practices that sets it apart from other traditions of magick, yet it can be found worldwide, particularly in tribal cultures, and in the foundations of visionary traditions. Not all mystics can be referred to as shamanistic in the truest sense of the word. <br>Core concepts to the practice of shamanism include the following: <br>�The ability to enter an altered state of consciousness through the use of sound, rhythm, movement, and plants. <br>�The experience of one or more nonphysical realities that are just as &#x201c;real&#x201d; to the practitioner as the physical world, and of actions in the nonphysical worlds that directly affect the physical world. <br>�The use of an altered state, a trance sometimes defined as an ecstasy, to project self-awareness from the physical world to the nonphysical worlds. <br>�Dealings with nonphysical beings, or spirits, who enter into a relationship with the practitioner. They offer guidance, healing, or power used to create change in the physical world. <br>�Other mystics may have the same gifts and abilities but do not access them through ecstatic trance or working with the spirits. Though they can be gifted medicine people or spell casters, without that link to the spirit world they are not necessarily shamans. <br>The voluntary interface with the unseen and the ability to use this link to create change is what sets a shaman apart from other magi. Shamans are typically equated with the title of &#x201c;medicine person,&#x201d; though not all medicine men and women use shamanic techniques to effect healing. <br>Humanity seems to be hard-wired with a few common ways to interface with the spirit world. These interfaces are a natural part of our physical and spiritual makeup. Wise ones across the globe separately discovered and applied these techniques and then applied their own cultural beliefs and rituals to them. These techniques have survived because they work. Archaeological evidence indicates that shamanic practice is at least 20,000 years old, making it truly the oldest profession. The recognition of core shamanic techniques in the lands beyond Siberia and the Americas has led to the somewhat controversial use of terms such as Celtic Shamanism and Norse Shamanism, applying a cultural adjective to the shamanic practice. <br>Practitioners of these other cultural traditions sometimes resent the label of shamanism. The word shaman, being from Siberia, was never used by the ancestors of the Celts, Norse, or any other Europeans. A Celtic practitioner once asked me why we don&#x2019;t say Siberian Druidism or Asian Druidism, and in a way he had a point. Through this anthropological choice, shamanism became a default term recognizable to all. <br>This practice of using the word shaman as a generic label has led to a bit of confusion and some difficult feelings. Those involved in the Native tribes feel that culturally it is their word and resent it being used as a generic label or default term. Modern pagans, sharing a similar spiritual history with tribal communities, should be sensitive to these feelings and make an effort to create bridges of understanding. As you study these techniques, it is important to remember that although there are great similarities between the healing practices of many cultures, there are also great differences in thought, philosophy, and interpretation. Such differences must be respected. <br>When I first started on my shamanic path, I attended a lecture in the Boston area by a scholarly and experienced Celtic practitioner of the Underworld traditions, visiting from the United Kingdom. He insisted, and made quite a convincing case, that there is no such thing as Celtic shamanism. In his opinion, people who use the term are careless, sloppy scholars and need to be better educated. The very next week, I attended another lecture by a Harvard scholar and practicing Celtic shaman who outlined the reasons why someone would call her practice shamanism. She, too, was quite convincing. <br>I realized then that if the professional experts can&#x2019;t agree, then perhaps there is no one right answer. I use the term shamanism myself because it&#x2019;s practical when teaching and I truly feel called to the word. I like its meaning, history, and associations. The practice of core shamanism, and how it relates to the traditions of witchcraft, is a primary focus of my own work. <br><b></b><b>Stone Age Witchcraft <br></b>When I teach workshops on core shamanism, during the introductions I hear stories of students who, like me, are of European descent. They tell me how they sought out spirituality in Native American traditions, going to drumming circles and sweat lodges, and how they are saddened that their own culture only has rigid, dogmatic institutions and not personal spiritual traditions. They ask me, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we have our own shamans? Why didn&#x2019;t we carry on these traditions?&#x201d; We did. Our shamans were called witches. <br>When I trace back the history of witchcraft and paganism, I find my oldest spiritual ancestors in the Stone Age. During the Stone Age, we have evidence of Goddess-reverent cultures. In these seemingly primitive cultures, there is evidence of ritual and ceremony. We had a people directly dependent upon nature for survival. They learned to partner with the environment around them to prosper. They honored the earth as Mother Goddess, and perhaps the grain, sun, or animals as Father God. They believed in the innate magick, divinity, and spirit in all things. They worked with these spirits to create change, ranging from a successful hunt to rainstorms. <br>In these tribes were people who acted as spiritual guides. They had a deeper sense of connection with the spirit world and psychic ability. They could partner with the spirits and gods to receive information from the unseen lands that would help the tribe. Most likely many of these wise ones were women, since in the hunter-gatherer societies, the females were protected because of their ability to bring life into the tribe, while one man could father many children. The older men and the injured hunters with spiritual ability would join these women, offering their gifts and guidance to the tribes. This started the archetypal image of the female witch, the wise old wizard, and the wounded healer. They were the first shamans. <br>As these lands developed into an agrarian society, many of these wise ones gathered to form the first temples and became the first priestesses and priests of society. <br>They used the tools of the new society, such as writing and formal ritual items, in their crafts. Eventually these mystics created the high arts of ceremonial magick and worship. We find these priestesses and priests influencing the rulers of the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Egypt as those cultures grew into their classical empires. <br>Some wise ones chose to stay on the fringes of society, without formal temples. They continued on their primal paths to power. They did not have formal schools of training, but kept their teaching personal and individual. They kept the ways of the herbs and medicines. They were in closer contact to untouched nature, the elements and the animals, and continued their relationship with all to better serve those in need. The newly evolving urbanites were more likely to go to the formal temples, while the rural peasants sought help from the simple wise woman or man. <br>Thus the traditions remained, as empires grew and crumbled. Migrations of many tribes from the East, those of the Celts and Teutons, stretched out across Europe, absorbing the culture, myths, and magick of the indigenous people of Europe, those who had erected the mounds, henges, and standing stones. When you go back to the Stone Age root of all these spiritual and magickal traditions, all evidence points to the core shamanic techniques as a common origin from which the others sprang. What we would now call the forms of European shamanism survived and flourished in many lands, changing with the times. From the Stone Age medicine woman to the image of the medieval witch, the role was one of healing, herbcraft, and midwifery, acting as a bridge between the worlds. <br>It wasn&#x2019;t until the rise of Christianity that Europe&#x2019;s magickal and shamanic traditions came under heavy fire. Intimately linked with what we now consider the pagan religions of old, practitioners of the magickal arts, those who partnered with the spiritual forces of worlds seen and unseen, became targets of fear and persecution. The old gods were called demons, and those who honored them became agents of evil in the minds of Church elders. We did have shamans in the form of witches, and we, as a culture, wiped most of them out and sent the rest underground. As logic, science, and technology replaced the old forms of mysticism, witches were cast into the land of fairy tales and make-believe, no longer taken seriously. <br>Those of European descent lost a rich shamanic history and tradition due to the persecutions of the Burning Times. Because of the propaganda that was spread, we don&#x2019;t even recognize the remnants of our heritage, though you can catch distorted glimpses of it in the witch-hunt trial transcripts. Though some magickal practices were preserved as folk wisdom and family secrets, others were resurrected through mythology and written lore. <br><b></b><b>The Surviving Traditions and Tribes <br></b>If our European traditions are broken lines of wisdom, where do we go to find the missing pieces of our past? In my search, I looked to the surviving tribal people. Unlike the Europeans, the surviving tribal people of the Americas did not turn on their own healers and mystics. The native magick was only in danger after the European invasions and subsequent missionary drives to convert the native population to Christianity by fear and force. This form of spirituality, although threatened, has survived relatively intact in the modern era. Even the anthropologists&#x2019; research records tribal ways and makes information more widely available. When I think of most primal forms of shamanic witchcraft in Stone Age Europe, I think their way of life, and general belief system, isn&#x2019;t too far from those keeping the tribal ways now. Modern tribes provide a template for modern witches to reclaim our shamanic ancestry. <br>As modern witches seek to reintroduce elements of shamanism into witchcraft, we look not only to the traditions in the New World, but also to the practices of surviving traditions of European shamanism. Some are tidbits of folk wisdom from the families of seers brought to light by contemporary scholars. Others are reconstructions of this wisdom based on the old mythologies and intuitive experimentation. Folk magick and re-constructionist traditions are the surviving branches of our older forms of European magick. <br>Although these cultures, both of the Old World and the New World, influence modern Wicca today, few Wiccans see their magickal practices as shamanic in origin. Hopefully, with more time and information, shamanic roots will be incorporated more fully into the practice of witchcraft. <br><b><i>African <br></i>African spiritual traditions are diverse in tribe, language, and location, but have many shamanic techniques in common. Most believe that one distant creative force charged a pantheon of lesser beings to regulate creation. The tribal medicine men function as intermediaries between the people and these spirits, as well as the ancestors. They are respected as priests and ministers. Rituals use music, drumming, and dance. Westerners see the influences of African spiritual traditions in the religions of Voodoo, Santeria, Condombl�, and Ifa. <br><i>Asian <br></i>The Asian spiritual traditions have a strong shamanic foundation, with its influence found in the nature-based spiritual practices of China, Tibet, Japan, and Korea. Technically, according to the etymology of the word, shamanism most appropriately refers to the practices of those spirit workers in Central Asia and Siberia. <br><i>Australian <br></i>Although not directly linked to modern traditions of witchcraft, the modern seeker&#x2019;s search for spirituality that led to the exploration of Native American traditions has also led the seeker to explore the traditions of the Australian aboriginals. As diverse as the tribes of the Americas and Africa, the Australian aboriginals share many shamanistic elements. Best known among them is the belief in the Dreamtime and the reverence of animal spirits. <br><i>Celtic <br></i>Though the true oral traditions of the Druids may have been lost, the mysteries of the Celts have been preserved through the myths and poetry of Celtic tradition. Even though many have been Christianized from their original pagan foundation, you can clearly see the roots of a culture well versed in the spirit world when you read the tales of Ireland regarding the Tuatha de Danaan, the Welsh Mabinogi myth cycle, the classic transformation of Taliesin the Bard, and the prophecies of Merlin. The pagan Celts were a culture that saw the spirit worlds side by side with the material world, and one step could easily take you through the gates of the human world into the realm of the spirits and gods. Proponents of the old faiths claim that Celtic shamanism has survived under the veil of Christianity in folk customs honoring the faery folk, second sight, spiritual healing and the Underworld tradition. Looking to the surviving folklore of the British Isles, I&#x2019;m inclined to agree. <br><i>Central and South American <br></i>The ancient empires of the Incans, Mayans, Aztecs, and Toltecs had rich shamanic cultures that survive today in Central and South America with modern practitioners. <br>Although each of these cul...</b></p><h2>Preaching 34579</h2><p><p>A standard textbook on the art and craft of preaching.

Although scholars have paid attention to the <i>Desert Mothers,</i> general lay audiences have only had access to writings by the Desert Fathers. Unlike most of the scholarly books on the market, this book popularizes the writings and the thinking of the <i>Desert Mothers</i> of the early Church, and applies them to contemporary life.</p><p><i><b>The Desert Mothers: Spiritual Practices from the Women of the Wilderness</b></i><b>, by Mary Earle</b> <p> <b>Q&amp;A for The Desert Mothers</b></p><p> By author Mary C. Earle</p><p> <b>Who were the desert mothers?</b> </p><p> These women lived in the fourth and fifth centuries, C.E. Their way of life came into being after Christianity had become legal and Christians were no longer under persecution. Some had deep questions about an expression of the faith that was taking on the trappings of the Roman Empire. The "red martyrdom" (sacrificing one's life rather than recanting faith in the resurrected Lord) was no longer possible. So the practice of the "white martyrdom" began to appear--women and men going to the deserts of Egypt and the Holy Land, and seeking to live out the Great Commandment: You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Luke 10:27, Dt. 6:5, Lev. 19:18) As scholar Roberta Bondi has pointed out, the desert mothers and fathers are remarkable for their daily practice of seeking to "love as God loves."</p><p> <b>What do we know about these women?</b></p><p> For one thing, we know there were a lot of them. One historian of the times tells us that there were twice as many women as men in the deserts. Another scholar said that there were so many Christians who sought to live this life in the desert that "the desert became a city." There were even accounts of "tourists" going out to the deserts to observe the ammas and abbas.</p><p> We know the names of four of these women whose sayings have been preserved: Amma Matrona, Amma Sarah, Amma Syncletica and Amma Theodora. And we know a little about their lives. We know, for example, that Amma Theodora was what we might call a spiritual director to bishops and other men in pubic position. We know that she was clear in her teaching and strong in her rebukes. We know that Amma Syncletica and her sister sought the life in the desert after their parents died. </p><p> Yet surrounding what we know is a vast silence. We have very little record of the thousands of women who lived this life of simplicity, silence and stillness. We have stories of others, such as Mary of Egypt (one good reference for that is <i> Harlots of the Desert</i> by Benedicta Ward).</p><p> <b>What does "amma" mean?</b></p><p> The word means "mother." It came to refer to those women who were spiritual mothers to many. They were wise teachers who were sought out for guidance in living the Christian life. </p><p></p><p> <b>The book is structured around nine concise sayings from the desert mothers. How did we receive these?</b></p><p> The desert tradition was an oral tradition which was then later written down. It was often the case that someone seeking to live a more faithful life would go to an amma (or an abba) and seek guidance with a decision, or a state of confusion, or the life of prayer. The sayings are pretty terse, and sometimes seem completely odd to us. We are inevitably reading them out of context; it helps to imagine two women sitting together, one asking the guidance of the other. </p><p> We have many more sayings from the desert fathers. In fact, we have a whole book worth of sayings (<i>The Sayings of the Desert Fathers</i>). The sayings of those four known ammas are included in that collection. Thanks to the work of scholars like Roberta Bondi and Mary Forman, we are beginning to see the ammas in their own light, and to reclaim women's history in this period of the life of the church.</p><p> <b>What do these desert mothers have to offer to us today?</b></p><p> I tell students that when we study the desert mothers and fathers, we have to remember that we are looking at a galaxy far, far away. I think it may be beyond the capacity of our imaginations to conceive of their time and culture. That said, it is also true that their sayings speak to deep human yearnings and to perennial human difficulties. We still judge one another constantly, thereby anointing ourselves as if we were God. We still stumble in the practice of living faithfully, and we need support. We still have difficulty being honest with ourselves and with God. The <i>ammas</i> know intimately these movements of the heart and soul, and they encourage us, they confront us and they guide us.</p><p> I also find their insistence on practicing silence, solitude and stillness a kind of medicine for our over-heated, frenetic culture. Many women today are trying to balance work, family, volunteering, and participation in a faith community. Our lives are harried, and we have no sense of being able to rest in the divine silence, the Source from which we come and to which we will return. When I am teaching this material, I always begin and end the class with simply sitting in silence. Inevitably, participants remark that it is like getting a drink when you are really thirsty, so thirsty you had forgotten what water tasted like. </p><p> The practices that the desert offers us are down to earth, simple ways of allowing ourselves to be reminded that we are always living in the Love which creates, redeems and sustains us. The ammas draw us away from the assumption that technique is what matters. They remind us that this is a way of life.</p><p> <b>Do you mean we should all go to the desert and become solitaries?</b></p><p> Certainly not. I mean that the human dimension of life in the desert is common to all of us. We are made for relationship with God and one another--one of the gifts of the Great Commandment is that it calls us to remember that basic truth. Knowing that in the abstract is one thing. Living it out in the nitty gritty of daily rounds is another. The ammas help us to find ways to gently pay attention to God's presence with us in all places and through all things. And they teach us to grow in the awareness that we are each unique, remarkable parts of a vast, vital, interconnected cosmos. We are reminded that we ARE one--that is reality from God's perspective. Our task is to align our lives and our loves in such a way that we participate in that reality. Most of us think we have to make the oneness. The desert knows the fallacy of that perception.</p><p> <b>What have you personally learned from the ammas?</b></p><p> First, I have learned to experiment. When these women decided to leave their lives--some of them were learned, some were fairly wealthy, some were prostitutes--they made a choice to try to create something new with one another and with God. There were a variety of models. Some were solitaries. Some were living in community. Some were solitaries who lived in huts, yet came together regularly for worship and meals. Initially, there was no single monolithic pattern. At midlife, I know that many women are trying to find patterns for living that are congruent with their experience and their faith. And sometimes we need examples from women's history to help us find what fits.</p><p> Second, the ammas have taught me to set aside time for quiet. There are so many pressures that lead us to be fragmented. The tradition does not deny the pressures. The ammas tells us that God is present even in those daily struggles. I can remember that more readily if I have taken time for quiet.</p><p> Third, the ammas take me back to basics. We live in a time in which so much polarization has happened in both the national political arena, and within the church. The ammas invite us to look beyond all the divisive fussing--not to deny it, but to see it as surface reality. They invite us to gaze more deeply, especially in the most tensive of circumstances.</p><p> And lastly, the ammas tell me that from the beginnings of the life of the Church, women have been initiators of new patterns and teachings, opening the way for knowing the wholeness that God offers in Christ. When I am reading the stories and sayings of the desert ammas, I am struck by their utter confidence that no matter what, this world belongs to God, is loved by God, and that each person, each creature, each aspect of the created order, is an expression (some would say a theophany, a showing) of God's love.</p>Mary C.

After a wrenching period of adjustment, he comes to feel rejuvenated by his involvement with the nation's first pro baseball players. He also finds his senses quickening and tastes changing as he faces life-threatening 19th-century challenges on and off the baseball diamond. Through his attachments to the ballplayers and the lovely Caitlin O'Neill, he might just regain the sense of family he desperately needs. Darryl Brock masterfully evokes post-Civil War America&#x2019;s smoky, turbulent cities, the new transcontinental railroad that takes passengers over prairies and mountains to California, the dance halls and parlor houses, the financial booms and busts, and historical luminaries like Mark Twain and Jesse James.

Should the children of believers be regarded as part of the covenant community, with the privileges and responsibilities that accompany that status? Or are they simply unbelievers, like children in the non-Christian world? What promise does God give believing parents and their children? What was the place of children in the Old Testament, and how does that compare with their position in the New?<br><br>These are some of the issues surrounding the question of whether to baptize infant children of believers. The sixteen contributors to this volume make a thorough biblical and theological case for covenant infant baptism. Contributors include: Gregg Strawbridge, Mark E. Ross, Cornelis P.

Cut off by language and politics from the Churches of the Roman Empire and branded "Nestorian," the Church of the East produced in isolation a rich theological literature which is only now becoming known to outsiders. Yet over the centuries and in all parts of Christendom, Isaac's works have been read and recommended as unquestionably orthodox.<br><br> Now, at last, to my great delight, we have at our disposal a single book in English, offering us a balanced and comprehensive overview of Isaac's life, background and teaching. Wisely, Fr. Hilarion Alfeyev has allowed Isaac to speak for himself. The book is full of well-chosen quotations, in which Isaac's true voice can be heard.<br><br> Saint Isaac of Syria was an ascetic, a mountain solitary, but his writings are universal in scope. They are addressed not just to the desert but to the city, not just to monastics but to all the baptized. With sharp vividness he speaks about themes relevant to every Christian: about repentance and humility, about prayer in its many forms, both outer and inner, about solitude and community, about silence, wonder, and ecstasy. Along with the emphasis that he places upon "luminous love"&#x2014;to use his own phrase&#x2014;two things above all mark his spiritual theology: his sense of God as living mystery; and his warm devotion to the Saviour Christ.</p><p>Now at last, to my great delight, we have at our disposal a single book in English, offering us a balanced and comprehensive overview of Isaac&#39;s life, background and teaching.

And this situation will continue as long as God's people insist on substituting intuition for truth, feeling for belief, and immediate gratification for enduring hope.</p><p>Yet if evangelicalism will again denounce this self-centered faith and place Christ and his cross at the center of its vision, the church will see great days once more. According to authors James Montgomery Boice and Philip Graham Ryken, this will happen when believers specifically return to the gospel foundation with its doctrines of radical depravity, unconditional election, particular redemption, efficacious grace, and persevering grace.</p><p>As these two noted pastors provide a compelling exposition of these essential truths, they also consider the current challenges, leaving no doubt that the church suffers when the doctrines of grace are neglected. Only in a faith that is practical-minded, kindhearted, and Bible-based will Christians recover what they have lost in this postmodern age.

The elements of the conflict now raging are unmistakable, in the vast expansion of industrial pursuits and the marvelous discoveries of science; in the changed relations between masters and workmen; in the enormous fortunes of some few individuals, and the utter poverty of the masses; the increased self-reliance and closer mutual combination of the working classes; as also, finally, in the prevailing moral degeneracy. The momentous gravity of the state of things now obtaining fills every mind with painful apprehension; wise men are discussing it; practical men are proposing schemes; popular meetings, legislatures, and rulers of nations are all busied with it - actually there is no question which has taken deeper hold on the public mind. 2. Therefore, venerable brethren, as on former occasions when it seemed opportune to refute false teaching, We have addressed you in the interests of the Church and of the common weal, and have issued letters bearing on political power, human liberty, the Christian constitution of the State, and like matters, so have We thought it expedient now to speak on the condition of the working classes. It is a subject on which We have already touched more than once, incidentally. But in the present letter, the responsibility of the apostolic office urges Us to treat the question of set purpose and in detail, in order that no misapprehension may exist as to the principles which truth and justice dictate for its settlement. The discussion is not easy, nor is it void of danger. It is no easy matter to define the relative rights and mutual duties of the rich and of the poor, of capital and of labor. And the danger lies in this, that crafty agitators are intent on making use of these differences of opinion to pervert men&#x2019;s judgments and to stir up the people to revolt.</p><p></p><h2>Above the Line: Living and Leading with Heart</h2><p><p><strong>A leadership consultant and neuropsychologist identify the universal habits of the heart and mind&#x2014;the keys to eliminating behavior patterns that hold us back, unlocking our true potential, and creating our best selves.</strong><br><br>Why is it so hard for leaders to coach employees who are struggling?

At first sight, the death of fifty-year-old Michele MacNeill, a formel model and mother of eight, appeared natural. But days after the funeral, when Dr. MacNeill moved his much-younger mistress into the family home, his children grew suspicious...</p><p> <b>A DECEPTIVE HUSBAND WHO WOULD KILL TO HAVE HIS WAY...</b><br> Soon the MacNeill daughters conducted their own investigation into their mother's death-only to uncover their father's multiple marital affairs, past criminal record, and falsified college transcripts he used to con his way into medical school. It would take six long years to solve the mystery of Michele MacNeill's death and secure a first-degree murder conviction. This is the shocking story about how one family unmasked a monster in their very own home-and lived to tell.</p></p><p><p>SHANNA HOGAN is a journalist and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of two previous true-crime books.

Roth</strong> <p></p> <b>1. Saving is mental ... and easier if you avoid advertising</b> <p></p> One of the best ways to win the mental battle to save is to reduce your exposure to advertising. Fight this by ignoring ads, or by learning to question their premises. <p></p> <b>2. Customize your saving (or, how to create your own Wii account)</b> <p></p> Each of us is different. We have different goals, we have different skills, and we have different mindsets. <p></p> Don't think of saving as a chore. Think of it as the golden ticket to getting the things you really want. I set up what I call "targeted savings accounts" at my bank, and I use these to save for my goals. When I wanted a Nintendo Wii, I opened a separate savings account at my credit union and I called it "Nintendo account." The teller laughed at me, but she understood what I was doing. It helped me save. <p></p> Each person needs to find a savings technique that matches her goals and abilities. If one method doesn't work, try another. Keep looking until you find a technique that works for you. <p></p> <b>3. Starter goals: vacations, cars and retirement</b> <p></p> A great way to develop the savings habit is to save for a vacation. We all love to take trips, right? Save for a fishing trip to Alaska. Save for a cruise to Belize. Save for a three-week tour of Paris. Whatever strikes your fancy. And once you've developed the saving habit, apply it to more practical things. <p></p> Another great goal is to save for a car. Too many people allow themselves to be trapped by a lifetime of car payments. It doesn't have to be that way. Develop a system that allows you to pay cash whenever you go shopping for a new vehicle. Earn interest on your car money instead of paying interest to somebody else. <p></p> And, of course, you should begin saving for retirement as soon as possible. This can be tough to do, especially if you're young. You think you've got decades to go, so why start today? You could use that money for a ski trip or a new iPad. But the sooner you start, the more time the extraordinary power of compounding has to help your money grow. If you don't think you can afford to (or want to) set aside 10 percent (or 25 percent, like my wife), then start small. Start with 5 percent. Or even 1 percent. Develop the habit and increase your saving with time. <p></p> <b>4. Limit your long-term goals and keep track of short-term tasks</b> <p></p> I only set a handful of long-term goals at a time. In fact, this year I only have one long-term goal. If we set too many goals, we spread our attention, and we're less likely to accomplish any of them. But if we concentrate on just a handful of things at once, we're more likely to do what we dream. <p></p> But while I don't have many long-term goals, I have a bunch of stuff I want to accomplish in the short term. To stay focused on these tasks, I use a simple but brilliant system I learned from Erica at erica.biz. I start on the first page of a spiral notebook. I make a brain dump of everything I have to do. Then I put the date at the top of the page. I refer to this list many times throughout the day, crossing things off the list as I go. If something else comes up that needs to be done, I add it to the bottom of the list. Every evening, I copy the list onto a new page and put the next day's date. This system works like a charm for me, not just for financial tasks, but for all tasks. <p></p> <b>5. Memberships/subscriptions you can cancel</b> <p></p> It can be difficult to give up things that we might consider "vices." For you, that might be the daily latte. For me, it's always been comic books. (Sad, but true.) These are constant money drains, but they also bring joy to our lives. Instead of giving these things up, I encourage folks to find ways to reduce them, or to save on them. <p></p> But to really save money, look for ways to reduce recurring monthly expenses. These are constant drags to your budget, and if you can reduce them, it's a great way to improve your cash flow. Some examples: <p></p> <b>Cancel your cable television and start watching shows online at Hulu.com or similar services.</b> Or, if that's too extreme, cut back from your deluxe digital package to bare minimum basic. I did this and saved over $600 a year.<br> <b>Cancel your magazine and newspaper subscriptions.</b> Yes, I know these industries are hurting, but so is your own budget.<br> <b>Cancel your gym membership.</b> Find cheap ways to exercise at home, including biking and running and yard work. Bodyweight exercises (like pushups and situps) are free and effective.<br> <b>Cancel other monthly memberships.</b> I used to pay $15/month to play an online videogame. Not only was this sucking my time away, but it was costing me $180 a year. I know that's not a lot, but when put together with other expenses, it can add up.<br> <b>Cancel your cell phone contract and move to pay-as-you-go.</b> In other countries, prepaid cell contracts are the norm. But for some reason, in the U.S., they're the exception, not the rule. As a result, folks end up paying through the nose, either because they have more service than they need, or because they don't have enough. With a prepaid plan, you only pay for what you need.<br> <br></p><p><p><b>J.D. Roth</b> is an accidental personal-finance expert--a regular guy who found himself deep in debt.

Her kitten has just survived a poisoning attempt, as has her aunt Matilda, the woman who always maintained that Franklin was alive in spite of his disappearance.</p><p>Lucky that Helen took her uncle's advice and contacted Perry Mason&#x2015;he immediately takes her as a client. But while it&#x2019;s clear that all the occurrences are connected, and that their connection will prove her innocence, the links in the case are too obscure to be recognized even by the attorney&#x2019;s brilliantly deductive mind. Risking disbarment for his unorthodox methods, he endeavors to outwit the police and solve the puzzle himself, enlisting the help of his secretary Della Street, his private eye Paul Drake, and the unlikely but invaluable aid of a careless but very clever kitten in the process.</p><p>Reprinted for the first time in over twenty years,&nbsp;The Case of the Careless Kitten&nbsp;is one of the most highly praised cases in the iconic Perry Mason series, which need not be read in any particular order.</p></p><p><p>Erle Stanley Gardner (1889-1970) was the best-selling American author of the 20th century, mainly due to the enormous success of his Perry Mason series, which numbered more than 80 novels and inspired a half-dozen motion pictures, radio programs, and a long-running television series that starred Raymond Burr. Having begun his career as a pulp writer, Gardner brought a hard-boiled style and sensibility to the early Mason books, but gradually developed into a more classic detective story novelist, showing enough clues to allow the astute reader to solve the mystery.

Moine</b>&nbsp;is a well-known convetion speaker and sales psychologist who has taught sales hypnosis to over 200 of America's top sales "superstars." Dr. Moine also writes sales script books and sales trainign films for Fortune 500 companies. Dr. Donald Moine is President of the Association of Human Achievement in Rolling Hills Estates, California.<br><br><b>Dr. Kenneth Lloyd</b>&nbsp;is an Organizational Development Consultant who runs his own management consulting firm in Sherman Oaks, California. He co-wrote an award winning film on communication, and he has a number of television scripts to his credit.<b>1<br>Unveiling The Best-Kept Secret Of Sales Superstars</b><p>It is an indisputable fact that top salespeople use forms of indirect or conversational hypnosis to command attention, build trust, garner respect and confidence, to create unforgettable impressions and to close sales. No one can argue with this fact.</p><p>University researchers have studied forms of conversational hypnosis for years. Studies of sales superstars have conclusively shown that they extensively use this powerful form of human communication.</p><p>Linguists are professionals who specialize in the study of how human beings use language. If anyone understands how the spoken word affects perception and thinking, it is linguists. Their research has shown that top salespeople and top negotiators and skilled attorneys all use similar forms of indirect hypnosis.</p><p>With all of the years of research that has been done, with all of the technical reports that have been published, with all of the indisputable proof we have that highly persuasive people do use conversational hypnosis, why is this finding so little understood and so shocking to the average person? Why have these techniques been kept secret?</p><p>The notion of using hypnosis as part of the sales process brings to mind images of unwary customers being tricked into buying products that they don&#x2019;t need and can&#x2019;t afford. It brings to mind the image of a salesman slowly waving a gold Cross pen in front of the prospect, back and forth, back and forth, until the prospect&#x2019;s eyes glass over, and his hand slowly reaches out for the pen and signs the order.</p><p>The above scenario is exactly what this book is not about. And, it is exactly what sales hypnosis is not about.</p><p>Keys that Unlock the Secret of Hypnotic Selling</p><p>Scientific studies of sales superstars have been conducted on elite salespeople who earn in excess of $100,000 per year in personal income. In our own studies, which were inaugurated in 1978, we have interviewed, traveled with, worked with and tape-recorded a wide variety of salespeople&#x2014;ranging from those who are flat broke to those who earn over $800,000 a year in personal income. Many of these sales champions cannot explain how they do what they do.</p><p>THUS, ONE OF THE REASONS THAT SALES HYPNOSIS HAS NOT BEEN TAUGHT PREVIOUSLY IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO PRACTICED IT COULD NOT THEMSELVES EXPLAIN HOW IT OPERATED. They could do sales hypnosis, but they didn&#x2019;t have the tools to break it down and teach it to others. Apparently, asking masters in the art of sales hypnosis to also be great teachers was akin to asking great athletes to also be great coaches. A great idea, but it is seldom realized.</p><p>The job was left to scientific researchers to discover the structure of sales hypnosis. The researchers found that highly successful salespeople use communication techniques which are nearly identical in structure to the communication techniques used by hypnotists.</p><p>The purpose of this book is to explain, for the first time, how sales superstars achieve results that are unattainable by average salespeople. In learning about sales hypnosis, you will discover that this powerful form of communication is ethical and, in fact, humanistic. You will learn many hypnotic sales techniques which will allow you to help an even greater number of people by being an even more effective sales professional.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s now remove the veil of secrecy that has previously surrounded conversational hypnosis. Let&#x2019;s learn how almost everyone can benefit from using these unique forms of human communication.</p><p>Getting Beyond Popular Conceptions and Misconceptions about Hypnosis</p><p>The proper place to start is to explain exactly what hypnosis is and what it isn&#x2019;t. As one of the most misunderstood of all human communication processes, hypnosis has been an easy target for sensationalism in movies and on television. Hypnosis has the power to both fascinate and frighten. There are still many well-educated people who erroneously believe that hypnosis is some form of &#x201c;sleep.&#x201d; While some people use hypnosis as an entertainment medium, the most widespread use of hypnosis today is in psychotherapy and counseling. Look under the &#x201c;H&#x201d; listings in your local telephone advertising directory to verify that almost every city and town in America now has hypnotists working in private practice. They use hypnosis in everything from helping people lose weight, helping them stop smoking, for stress reduction, and in marriage counseling and psychotherapy. Hypnosis is also used by many dentists for pain control. Someone who is allergic to anesthesia can be hypnotized prior to dental work to block all perceptions of pain.</p><p>The most recently discovered area for the application of hypnosis is business, management and sales. Of these, the specialization experiencing the greatest growth is sales hypnosis. This is the first book about the exciting and rapidly growing field of sales hypnosis.</p><p>The experts still disagree about the one &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; definition of hypnosis. However, there is little disagreement about its key components. Many of the key components of hypnotic language, you might be surprised to learn, occur naturally in everyday life.</p><p>The best way to understand hypnosis is to look at it as a state of greatly increased suggestibility. That is, the hypnotized person is far more susceptible to influence by messages and images. Have you been looking for methods to increase your ability to influence others? If so, you will find that hypnosis has many of the techniques you&#x2019;ve been seeking.</p><p>Recognizing Hypnosis as a Part of Everyday Life</p><p>There are different levels of hypnosis which you can observe everyday in your friends and business associates. In light hypnosis, your body may feel relaxed and you might be aware of &#x201c;day-dreaming.&#x201d; Anyone who is capable of concentrating for a few minutes can easily enter this state. Light hypnosis is a wonderful altered state of awareness for programming your mind so that you can achieve higher levels of success and have more focused energy.</p><p>People who are in a medium-level hypnotic state are not distracted by outside disturbances, and may also have a semi-glazed or unfocused look in their eyes. They may be reading a book or pushing a grocery cart and not even respond to a loud noise a few feet away. Medium-level hypnotic states can also be accompanied by very deep levels of relaxation, or a complete lack of awareness of the body.</p><p>In the deepest levels of hypnosis, you may not even be able to remember what has happened during hypnosis. You may have what is known as &#x201c;hypnotic amnesia.&#x201d; In the deepest levels of hypnosis, the powers of the human imagination are greatly increased. At this level of hypnosis, if a person is given an onion and if that person is told it is a delicious apple, he will eat it as if it were an apple. Root canals, amputations and other operations have been performed on people using only deep hypnosis as the anesthesia. Physical strength can also be significantly increased. Many Olympic-calibre weight lifters and marathon runners use self-hypnosis to increase their abilities to perform and to decrease the perception of pain. While deep hypnosis, or trance hypnosis, is a fascinating subject to study, there is seldom, if ever, any need for this level of hypnosis in sales.</p><p>Hypnosis is a constantly changing and fluid state. Within five minutes, you or a customer might momentarily drop to a deep level of hypnosis, relive a pleasant memory or association, then rise to a light hypnosis, engage in some conversation, and then drop to a medium level of hypnosis. If you have ever listened to a sales professional, fallen in love with a product, bought it, and then not remembered why you bought it, you were probably in and out of two or more different levels of hypnosis.</p><p>There is no conflict between hypnosis and reason. That is, you or one of your customers can be both highly rational and can also be in a hypnotic state. The hypnosis may trigger the powers of the imagination, but it will not overrule logic and reason. You cannot, for example, hypnotize someone and tell them to commit murder. It won&#x2019;t happen. You can&#x2019;t and wouldn&#x2019;t want to hypnotize someone and tell them to buy a product they don&#x2019;t want or need. They won&#x2019;t buy it.</p><p>However, if someone does want a product and does need it, hypnosis will give you an extra edge in selling it. It is the edge that sales superstars have had for many, many years&#x2014;and now you can learn how it is done.</p><p>When you communicate a message hypnotically, that message is more likely to bypass the listener&#x2019;s conscious defenses. The hypnotic message goes more directly to the prospect&#x2019;s subconscious mind. Communications researchers have found that there are four distinct ways of sending these messages or suggestions, and these are explained in the following section.</p><p>Four Ways to Send Practically Irresistible Suggestions</p><p>When people use Verbal Suggestions, they use words in a very direct fashion to make suggestions. While this form of suggestion is the most commonly used, it is not necessarily the most powerful. Let&#x2019;s look at some examples from classical hypnosis, from everyday life, and from sales. From classical hypnosis:</p><p><b>&#x201c;Your eyelids are getting heavy and you are beginning to feel sleepy . . .&#x201d;</b></p><p>From everyday life: <b>&#x201c;You are going to love this meal!&#x201d;</b></p><p>From sales hypnosis: <b>&#x201c;You are going to be very excited about what this computer can do!&#x201d;</b></p><p>While the content of these verbal suggestions is quite different, the structure is the same. These suggestions set up expectations. They work because people get what they think they are going to get out of an experience. They work because thoughts can become self-fulfilling prophecies. If someone thinks they will like something, chances are they will like it. If they doubt they will like it, chances are they won&#x2019;t like it.</p><p>The choice of words and the ordering of words in verbal suggestions has the power to change the way people think. Napoleon said, <b>&#x201c;We rule men with words.&#x201d;</b> In an upcoming chapter on Sales Scripting, you will learn how to script nearly irresistible sales presentations. The scripting of important presentations is now being done on a widespread basis by people in many different professions (including lawyers), and nowadays even our President is scripted before every major speech.</p><p>To be successful in sales, it is essential to understand the psychology of verbal suggestion. Verbal suggestion is what gives you the power to influence how a customer or prospect thinks. You earn your living based on your powers of verbal suggestion. As you will see, the suggestions that sales superstars make are planted in an elegant and nearly invisible way. Customers end up with the feeling that, &#x201c;It was my idea to buy this! I wasn&#x2019;t sold anything&#x2014;I bought it!&#x201d;</p><p>If delivered with enthusiasm and sincerity, the verbal suggestion gains even more power. While the words you use in verbal suggestions are crucial, they are not the entire picture. Presentation style is also vital. In the coming chapters, you will learn verbal presentation techniques to add hypnotic impact to nearly all of your messages.</p><p>Why isn&#x2019;t direct suggestion more powerful? Because its content is easily recognizable. Direct suggestions are the kind of suggestions most salespeople make&#x2014;and they are the kind of suggestions customers have the most defenses against. Prospects and customers develop a variety of sophisticated filters which screen out many forms of direct suggestion. The other forms of suggestion that you will learn about here by-pass the majority of filters that customers possess. Filters are by-passed because these other forms of suggestion seem almost &#x201c;invisible&#x201d; on the surface. Yet, on the subconscious or subliminal level, they have a tremendous positive impact.</p><p>The second type of suggestion is Non-Verbal. Selected gestures and facial expressions add hypnotic impact and emphasis to messages. For example, when you watch a skilled actor in a fascinating film, you can become almost completely mesmerized by the performance. You lose all perception of time. Before you know it, another half-hour has gone by. You may even lose awareness of your body, and your foot or your leg may fall asleep. You entered a hypnotic state of deeply focused attention and heightened suggestibility. Non-verbal suggestion is a tool used by both skilled actors and top salespeople.</p><p>One very powerful way of using non-verbal suggestion is to match or mirror the body language of your customer. We all trust people like ourselves, and by matching your customer&#x2019;s body language, you are sending a message of &#x201c;I am like you are.&#x201d; This subconsciously increases the customer&#x2019;s comfort level and decreases his or her resistance. On a subliminal level, the customer feels in harmony with you. When you adopt the body language of your customer, you are telling him or her on a non-verbal level that you have something in common.</p><p>One of the classic methods of inducing hypnosis, which has been in use for at least one-hundred years, involves having a patient look into a mirror while the hypnotist counts backward and tells stories. When you match or mirror a customer&#x2019;s body language, you are sending back a hypnotic mirror image to that customer. Many customers look for differences in salespeople. They avoid buying by telling themselves, &#x201c;The salesman is different from me. He is trying to sell me something.&#x201d; When the salesperson appears to be very similar to the customer, by matching body language and movements on a subliminal level, that salesperson is more trusted and is harder to resist. Psychological research tells us that people cannot resist themselves or their own actions.</p><p>Besides matching or mirroring body language, you can induce hypnosis with your smile. The smile works by sending a powerful non-verbal message of &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s be friends,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get closer.&#x201d; Sonny Salkind, one of the top real estate salesmen in America, has a wonderful, warm smile that melts people when they first meet him. Like Sonny, you should remind yourself to use your smile strategically as a form of non-verbal suggestion from the very first moment you meet a prospect or customer.</p><p>Intraverbal Suggestions, the third form of suggestion, come from intonations and voice inflections. When a hypnotist uses the word &#x201c;sleep,&#x201d; he usually pronounces it in a soft deep voice and extends it out into &#x201c;sssssssslllllllleeeeeeeeppppppppp.&#x201d; These special intonations and voice inflections give the word extra power. In the same way, sales professionals turn certain words into action commands by changing the intonations:</p><p><b>&#x201c;Think of how hhhaaaapppppyyyy your wife will be when you give her this new sports car!&#x201d;</b></p><p>In this example, a long resonant intonation on the word &#x201c;happy,&#x201d; triggers positive feeling in the customer. He has an immediate positive experience of his wife&#x2019;s happiness. If the salesman just spit the words out, they would have little effect. It is the intraverbal suggestion that gives them all their power. Your voice inflections can actually trigger happiness in the listener in the instant he hears such a suggestion!</p><p>The intonations given to a word can change its impact and meaning 180 degrees. A word can send totally opposite me...</p></p><h2>The Silenced (Krewe of Hunters, 15)</h2><p><strong>Where is Lara Mayhew?</strong><br><br>Lara, a congressman&#x2019;s media assistant, suddenly quits her job&#x2014;and disappears on the way to her Washington, DC, apartment.<br><br>Novice FBI agent Meg Murray, a childhood friend of Lara&#x2019;s, gets a message from her that same night, a message that says she&#x2019;s disillusioned and &#x201c;going home.&#x201d; To Richmond, Virginia.

More troops had been killed overseas. A truck had stalled on the beltway, causing a ten-car pileup. Investigations were still under way regarding the death of Garth Hubbard, the indie presidential hopeful beloved by so many that he might've been the first man to take the White House on such a ticket. The cause of his death had been deemed natural. He'd been at home with his wife, alone in their bedroom. Paramedics had been called; his family doctor had come, too, and signed the death certificate.

There was an orientation class she was required to attend and she wanted to get through it quickly so she could concentrate on moving into her little town house before her life began anew.<br><br>As she relished the hot water pouring over her in the shower, Meg considered the life she was about to start.<br><br>As a child, she'd dreamed of changing the world. That had meant to her that she had to be a policewoman or run for president. Maybe a policewoman&#x2014;and <em>then</em> the president.<br><br>And when she was ten years old, her family had fallen victim to a horrible crime.<br><br>She would never forget it. She could still remember that time as clearly as if she'd just lived it. Her cousin, responsible and steadfast, had gone missing. Then the ransom note had come.<br><br>But Mary Elizabeth's body had been found. Meg had known they'd find her before they did. Everything about those days, that experience, had been shattering and devastating, and for a long time, she'd thought she was crazy. But she hadn't been. And now...<br><br>Now, all she could only hope to do was put away some of the bad guys. Just as they'd put away the man who'd taken Mary Elizabeth.<br><br>In her classes, they'd recently had guest speakers, agents and scientists from the behavioral science units. Listening to what man was capable of doing to man had been horrifying, despite what she already knew. The academy classes lost students along the way because sometimes it was too much to bear.<br><br>In her case.<br><br>She was even more determined. She had every reason to be.<br><br>Because it hadn't ended with Mary Elizabeth. Sometimes she met people who'd been tortured. And killed.<br><br>And she'd wanted to help.<br><br>She liked to feel that she'd grown strong. Her superiors and teachers knew about her past&#x2014;about Mary Elizabeth being kidnapped and murdered. She was honest about her desire to be with the Bureau. She was careful not to dwell on the past in case someone believed that her previous experience might hinder her work.<br><br>It would never interfere with her work; she was sure of that.<br><br>Dressed and ready for the day, she checked her reflection in the mirror. She wore a blue pantsuit, very regulation. Her shirt was white, but she was allowed pinstripes, thin lines in a pale blue. Somehow, they made her feel a little brighter.<br><br>She was young, but at a height of five-ten she was often assumed to be older than her actual age of twenty-six. She had a wealth of thick, nearly black hair, which she'd pulled back into a bun. She almost turned away from the mirror, but then studied her reflection more closely. She thought her mouth was too big, as were her eyes. At least they were a clear, dark sky blue. She studied herself critically and decided she looked presentable. And especially dressed like this, she seemed to exude confidence, maybe even authority.<br><br>With a shake of her head, she finally turned away. She really wanted to believe that she had the right stuff. She'd gone through college, studying criminology, become a cop in Richmond for a couple of years and then been accepted to the academy. It was the career she wanted; she'd gone after it step-by-step.<br><br>She reached for her phone in the charger at her bedside and realized the message light was blinking.<br><br>Lara had called her. She frowned; the call had come in the middle of the night. Lara never called her that late. She listened to the message.<br><br>"Meg, it's me, Lara. I wanted to let you know I'm going home. Home, as in getting out of DC. I'm going as soon as it's daylight. I'll talk to you when I can. Love you. Don't say anything to anyone else, okay? I have to get out of here. Talk soon."<br><br>There was a second call, a second message. But Meg heard nothing&#x2014;except what sounded like a rush of wind and a muffled thump.<br><br>A purse dial?<br><br>Perplexed, Meg played the message again and tried to phone Lara back. The call went immediately to voice mail. Her friend had seemed breathless, so she'd probably been walking when she'd made the call.<br><br>But she'd sounded distracted&#x2014;and a little frantic.<br><br>Meg left a message herself. "Call me back. You've got me really worried. Please, call me as soon as you possibly can."<br><br>Disturbed, she added a last "Please!"<br><br>She told herself that Lara had just become disgusted with politics; many people did.<br><br><em>Not Lara!</em> she thought.<br><br>Lara had been a media and research assistant in the offices of Congressman Ian Walker. Lara had admired the congressman from his first speeches, when they were still in high school in Richmond. Walker was passionate about equality, whether racial, religious or sexual. He was also critical of irresponsible spending, the unusual politician who managed to be both fiscally responsible and socially liberal. He fought hard for his causes on the house floor.<br><br>Why would Lara suddenly decide to go home? It didn't make sense!<br><br>She lay on the silver gurney as if she were sleeping, and Agent Matt Bosworth believed that she'd once been a lovely young woman.<br><br>Death had not been kind. She was now a bloated, pallid corpse, ravaged by the river and creatures of the water. It was difficult to tell where the autopsy Y incision had actually been made; he knew she'd been ripped from throat to groin, disemboweled and stuffed with rocks. But time had caused the rocks to dislodge from their human cave and she had floated to the surface and then the riverbank, where she'd been found by the boat motor of a pleasure sailor on the Potomac.<br><br>Matt knew that another woman had been found at the beginning of June&#x2014;but she'd washed up on the Maryland side of the river.<br><br>The woman now lying on the gurney before him had shown up on the DC side. She'd come to the office of the chief medical examiner, or OCME, for the District of Columbia. It was a relatively new, state-of-the-art facility that handled about seventeen hundred cases a year&#x2014;of death by violence, death unattended by a physician, unexpected death or death with the possibility of spreading disease.<br><br>The offices were large and also housed forensic labs, reception areas to provide information to family and friends, and staff who offered counseling. The workers here were often distraught when the public thought&#x2014;due to numerous television shows&#x2014;that answers were revealed within the space of an hour.<br><br>Death was seldom so easy.<br><br>But Matt had faith that whatever could be learned about the deceased would be learned here. All in all, he was glad the FBI was involved&#x2014;and that everything on these murders would be handled as one case. While Matt wasn't surprised that it had so quickly become a federal case, he <em>was</em> surprised that the Krewe&#x2014;a specialized unit&#x2014;had been called in.<br><br>DC wasn't geographically large, not compared to other major metropolises. But with Capitol police, District police, Maryland and Virginia police and the FBI, jurisdiction might have become a bit confused. However, since these two murders were in Maryland and the District, it seemed logical that the FBI would take the lead. There were dozens of elite units at headquarters that might've been called in. But it had been the Krewe.<br><br>Matt hadn't questioned the details yet. He'd come into work and Jackson Crow had informed him that they were heading out. In time he'd find out what had happened&#x2014;and what was going on now.<br><br>He'd been with the Krewe for about eight months, invited in after he'd explained to his superiors that he'd been "lucky" when he'd wandered into the bar where a serial killer had stalked his victims. It had actually been the ghost of a young victim who'd shown him the way. Matt figured that Jackson&#x2014;Special Agent in Charge Jackson Crow&#x2014;and Adam Harrison, Krewe director, had watched his work.<br><br>And known that he'd be right for the unit.<br><br>Matt had never understood why he saw the dead&#x2014;or why the dead seemed to talk to him. He hadn't had a traumatic life; he'd had a good one, with great parents and a solid education. A family friend had assisted in getting him into Virginia Military Institute. He'd served in the military, and after that, he'd decided he wanted the FBI. He'd heard about the Krewe of Hunters and known he wanted in. He also knew that the Krewe invited its agents to join; it wasn't something you applied for. So he'd waited patiently.<br><br>He'd seen and communicated with the dead since he was a kid, but he'd realized that others didn't. And he'd also realized that if you wanted to be taken seriously, you didn't tell anyone that you spoke to the dead.<br><br>After several years in the FBI and that one particular case, he'd been invited in. He'd been happy to be with the Krewe. No more pretense.<br><br>So, that morning, he hadn't questioned Jackson. They'd find out soon enough exactly what they were looking at.<br><br>It hadn't taken them long to reach the OCME; their offices in Alexandria weren't that far from it. He liked their new location, a pair of beautiful old row houses that were also host to FBI internet personnel, other agents and some civilian employees. They could easily commute to the Capitol and the facilities at Quantico.<br><br>So far, Matt had learned that they'd been specifically called in when the second body was found. While three killings officially called for a serial killer investigation, the brutality done to both women had caused the captain of the Maryland force to alert the FBI. The assistant director at headquarters had called Adam Harrison, and Adam had directed Jackson to take the case.<br><br>But while the situation was grim and the perpetrator obviously a heinous killer, there didn't seem to be much reason for the Krewe to be called in. Nothing seemed to hint at the paranormal; this was murder at its most brutal, but sadly, such killers had existed before and would again. He'd eventually learn the whys of this case. Right now, they needed to learn what they could from the body&#x2014;and from the DC cop, Carl Hunter, who'd been the detective called to the scene.<br><br>"The cause of death was the slashed throat?" Matt asked, after the ME, Dr. Wong, finished listing the injuries to the body. He spoke through a paper mask, as had the doctor. The smell of decay was strong.<br><br>Wong was a bright man in his early forties, clear and concise in his manner. He looked at Matt and nodded. "The throat was slashed. It would've taken the victim time to exsanguinate, and some of the slicing on the body was performed before death, but she was so heavily drugged that I don't think she felt anything, including the slash to her throat."<br><br>"I understand it was a right-handed killer," Detective Hunter said. "That's correct, Dr. Wong?"<br><br>Carl's voice sounded scratchy. Matt understood. Carl was a good guy; they'd met during a few earlier cases. The man was a dogged investigator, putting in long hours. He was nearing retirement, but hadn't slacked off in the time or determination he gave a case.<br><br>He'd seen a lot.<br><br>This was still hard to tolerate.<br><br>"Yes," Wong said. "He was right-handed and very certain in his movements. No hesitation marks at all. The guy's done this before."<br><br>"Were any organs taken?" Jackson Crow asked.<br><br>"The tongue is missing," Wong said. He cleared his throat. "Bits of organs are missing&#x2014;but that's because the ripping of the stomach caused pieces to...fall out."<br><br>Matt leaned forward to see the atrocity Wong showed them, setting a hand on the dead woman's shoulder as he viewed her ruined mouth.<br><br>Her shoulder was cold, cold as ice. It was shocking what the body felt like when life was gone, so still and cold, as if the soul, the very essence of what had been human, had flown and left emptiness behind.

Chuck Blakeman is clear. <br><br>When reviewing Making Money is Killing Your Business, the biggest urge I had was just to cut and paste whole sections of it, Here's a sample: <br><br>I think businesses should grow up...I don't mean it would be nice if it happened. I mean we should all, everyone of us, expect our businesses to grow up and start giving back to us and to the world around us. We should assume that at some point our business would move from survival right through success to Significance. <br><br>Nobody would argue with me that we should intend for our children to grow up, leave home, and become grownups we could enjoy for decades, but when was the last time we had a similar conversation about our businesses? It's normal for children to grow up, so why isn't it normal for businesses to do the same thing? Frankly, we&#x2019;re in charge of both of them at birth, and if you&#x2019;ve had kids, you&#x2019;ll know that you&#x2019;ve got more control over the maturity of your business than the maturity of your kids. <br><br>Chuck does more than offer a simple paradigm shift. He shows how to do it, and shares examples of clients who walked that walk with him. Real crisp, concise examples, including the client&#x2019;s words and actionable steps that you can do...today. <br><br>Given the clarity of writing and the proven, doable steps that Chuck shares in Making Money is Killing Your Business, it deserves sales like Good to Great by Jim Collins. That would put sales for Chuck's book at around 3-4 million. That sounds right. --Zane Safrit Book Reviews Making Money is Killing Your Business has been translated to Mandarin and is being distributed in mainland China. <br><br>It has also been translated to Spanish for availability in all Spanish-speaking countries. --Amazon - Books <br></p><h2>The 9 Ways Of Working</h2><p><i>The 9 Ways of Working</i> introduces the nine personality styles of the Enneagram, a classic, highly powerful approach to work and life. Each of the Enneagram's nine types has a distinct worldview which determines how they think, what they want, and why they act the way they do. You'll recognize the personality types of the people you work with---colleagues, clients, bosses---as well as your own. And you'll discover the most effective ways to work with these people: <br><ol><li> The Perfectionist gets things done right---regardless of the consequences. <br></li><li>The Helper nurtures others' careers---and demands to be appreciated for it. <br></li><li>The Producer works hard to succeed---but can burn out in overwork. <br></li><li>The Connoisseur explores his or her creativity and deep feelings---but may get lost in them. <br></li><li>The Sage craves data, theories and insight---but may forget the human element <br></li><li>The Troubleshooter knows the secrets and who can be trusted---but can get mighty paranoid. <br></li><li>The Visionary inspires with brilliant, fun, imaginative ideas---but leaves closure to others. <br></li><li>The Top Dog exercises leadership---but may end up as a vengeful bully. <br></li><li>The Mediator wants everybody working as a conflict-free team---but may forget his or her own goals. </li></ol>Drawing on twenty-five years of teaching and consulting, Michael Goldberg's rich descriptions catch the "aha!" of each style with insightful anecdotes and real-life stories. He shows how each style is likely to connect with or miss the others, what kind of leadership is right for certain situations, and how each style makes important decisions and gets work done. You'll see the special gifts and talents of each style, their limits and blind spots, and when they will shine and when they will wilt. <i>The 9 Ways of Working</i> is packed with practical tips and cautions for each style and for working with each style. <br><br></p><p><b>Michael J. Goldberg</b> teaches businesses all over the world how to use the Enneagram. He lives in Santa Barbara, CA.Based on ancient philosophic traditions, the Enneagram is a profound, elegant, and compassionate approach to people and their relationships. It describes nine basic worldviews, nine different ways of doing business in the world. Each of the nine personality types is something of a pathway through life, with likely obstacles and pitfalls along the way. Each style has its own natural gifts, limitations, and blind spots, its own distinctive ways of thinking, acting, and being. Each relishes particular information, facts, feelings, and understandings, while ignoring other information, especially anything that doesn't fit preconceived notions or inclinations. <p>"Every man, wherever he goes, is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions," wrote Bertrand Russell, "which move with him like flies on a summer's day. Such convictions normally go unexamined and unchallenged partly because they are indeed comforting, (I know how the world works) and because they have become so basic to our worldview that they are largely unconscious. The Enneagram exposes these unconscious assumptions, closely held opinions, inclinations and expectations, that we barely knew we had but which drive the way we see ourselves, do our work, relate to colleagues and make decisions. Instead of operating out of habit from comforting convictions you can, with clear intent, invoke your true reservoir of talents and skills. </p><p>Naturally we interpret other people's behaviors through our own way of looking at things. We tend to see our own stance as baseline, more or less objective. We judge the behavior of others as variously supportive or inconsiderate, conventional or bizarre, intrusive or stand-offish. But when we know where others find themselves on the Enneagram we see that their behavior too grows out of a consistent philosophy of life that makes perfect sense to them, whether you agree with it or not. You can then tailor your message to the deeply held concerns of the listener, even if these concerns are not clearly expressed or even conscious. Many of us yield to the temptation to think of the other types as a defective version of our own. But the Enneagram teaches that we are different in important ways... </p><p>The real message of the Enneagram is that we approach the world with contrasting patterns of intention and attention (our purposes and our values) that give meaning to our world. Knowing these organizing principles makes real understanding possible; not knowing them seems to make misunderstandings inevitable. The Enneagram opens us to the experience of others, and helps us get out of our own way.</p></p><h2>A Scandalous Freedom: The Radical Nature of the Gospel</h2><p>Christians do not trust freedom. As author Steve Brown explains in this brave new book, they prefer the security of rules and self-imposed boundaries, which they tend to inflict on other Christians. Brown asserts that real freedom means the freedom to be wrong as well as right. Christianity often calls us to live beyond the boundaries, bolstered by the assurance that we cannot fall beyond God's love. Freedom is dangerous, but the alternative is worse -- boxing ourselves up where we cannot celebrate our unique gifts and express our joy in Christ. Each of the book's eleven chapters explores a common pharisaic, freedom-stifling tendency, then opens the door to the fresh air of a remedial liberty. A reader's delight, <i>A Scandalous Freedom</i> sometimes shocks with challenges to prevailing wisdom, but it follows up with compelling validations of our need to celebrate real, unstinted freedom in Christ.</p><p><b>Dr. Steve Brown </b>is a broadcaster, seminary professor, author, and founder and president of Key Life Network.&nbsp; He previously served as a pastor for over twenty-five years and now devotes much of his time to the radio broadcasts, <i>Key Life</i> and <i>Steve Brown Etc</i>. Dr. Brown serves as Professor Emeritus of Preaching at Reformed Theological Seminary teaching at the campuses in Atlanta, Orlando and Washington, D.C. He sits on the board of the National Religious Broadcasters and Harvest USA. Steve is the author of numerous books, and his articles appear in such magazines and journals as <i>Christianity Today, Leadership, Relevant, Leadership, Decision, Plain Truth</i> and <i>Today's Christian Woman</i>. Traveling extensively, he is a much-in-demand speaker. Steve and his wife Anna have two daughters and three granddaughters.The best radio-show hosts speak not to a group of people but to individuals&#x2014;listeners feel the show is just for them. Brown (<i>Born Free</i>), a Presbyterian seminary professor, former pastor and host of the <i>Key Life</i> radio program, uses that approach to fine effect as he encourages Christians to celebrate their absolute freedom. Conversational, lighthearted and full of funny lines (and a few urban legends presented as fact), Brown's writing nevertheless conveys deep truth: believers too often stagger beneath a burden of behavior forced on them by other Christians, a standard that God does not require. "I fear too often the church has become an organization of guilty people with a guilty preacher standing in the pulpit, telling guilty people that they should feel guiltier," he writes. The oppressed and their oppressors miss the power of authenticity, especially the freedom to fail, the joy of God's complete forgiveness and the boldness it brings. God's liberty also lets Christians embrace those with whom they disagree. Brown illustrates the point in one of his best anecdotes, recalling his relationship with Tony Campolo. Brown's honesty about his own failings drives his points home. This book has the power to help Christian believers who have been struggling to march in a straight line to leap up and dance. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A young woman has been injured while exploring a cave in New Mexico?s Carlsbad Cavern Park. Before she can be pulled to safety, she sends for her friend Anna. Only one problem: a crushing fear of confined spaces has kept Anna out in the open her whole life.</p><p>Feisty, resourceful forest ranger Anna Pigeon faced everything from raging fires to deep-water dives with cool aplomb in her first five adventures. Very early in <i>Blind Descent</i> her courage is put to an even greater test when she learns that a woman seriously injured while exploring a cave next door to New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns is a friend who has requested Pigeon's help in getting her out. "A chilling image filled Anna's mind: herself crouched and whimpering, fear pouring like poison through her limbs, shutting down her brain as the cave closed in around her." Pushing aside her fears, Pigeon takes the plunge, leading readers through a truly harrowing series of tight squeezes. Nevada Barr is so good at involving us in Anna's terror that when she finally resurfaces, we share her "unadulterated joy. Even the dirt smelled alive... When she saw her first stars, she croaked out her delight from tired lungs." Above ground, Anna quickly gets involved in two possibly linked murders and becomes a rifleman's target. As we share the progress of her investigation, a sneaky suspicion starts to grow of possible suspects within the small community of spelunkers and National Park Service bureaucrats. Barr couldn't possibly ask Anna to go back underground again, could she? When it happens, of course, it seems inevitable--and just as frightening as the first time.Formerly an actress and a park ranger,&nbsp;<b>Nevada Barr&nbsp;</b>is now&nbsp;an award-winning and <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling novelist and creator&nbsp;of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and numerous other books and short stories.

But when the family business failed and his parents&#x2019; marriage fell apart, Williams discovered that his dark-skinned father, who had been passing as Italian-American, was half black. The family split up, and Greg, his younger brother, and their father moved to Muncie, Indiana, where the young boys learned the truth about their heritage. Overnight, Greg Williams became black.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this extraordinary and powerful memoir, Williams recounts his remarkable journey along the color line and illuminates the contrasts between the black and white worlds: one of privilege, opportunity and comfort, the other of deprivation, repression, and struggle. He tells of the hostility and prejudice he encountered all too often, from both blacks and whites, and the surprising moments of encouragement and acceptance he found from each.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Life on the Color Line </i>is a uniquely important book. It is a wonderfully inspiring testament of purpose, perseverance, and human triumph.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Heartbreaking and uplifting... a searing book about race and prejudice in America... brims with insights that only someone who has lived on both sides of the racial divide could gain.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i></b></p><p><b>Gregory Howard Williams</b>&nbsp;is an attorney, law school professor, and the former President of the&nbsp;University of Cincinnati&nbsp;(2009&#x2013;2012) and the City College of New York (2001&#x2013;2009). He is the author of <i>Life on the Color Line.</i>The title <i>sounds</i> like tabloid sensationalism, but Williams' memoir is, in fact, a moving story of growing up on both sides of the nation's racial thicket. Williams' mother was white and his father was able to "pass," so their children, growing up in northern Virginia, thought they were Italian. The parents split up in the mid-1950s, and Buster Williams' alcoholism drove him into bankruptcy, so the charming ne'er-do-well took his two older boys to his darker-skinned family in Muncie, Indiana (just miles across town from their maternal relatives, most of whom no longer acknowledged their existence). Buster Williams encouraged Greg to study and aspire to great things and taught younger brother Mike to hustle, but he was unable to care for the boys and allowed a pious widow to take them in. In grade school and junior and senior high, Greg had to prove himself to both races over and over again: white girls were off-limits, of course, but the sight of him with African American girls of various shades also caused consternation. School records were marked to make sure teachers would realize he was "colored." <i>Life on the Color Line</i> follows Williams to college and to a brief, painful reunion with his natural mother. A powerful tale of a young man's struggle on the cusp of the nation's racial conflicts and confusions. <i>Mary Carroll</i></p><h2>Jesus Undefeated: Condemning the False Doctrine of Eternal Torment</h2><p><p><strong>What if God is better than you think and hell isn't an eternal torture chamber?</strong></p><p>Many Christians are unaware that Universal Reconciliation was the dominant view of the church for the first 500 years, with Annihilation and Eternal Torment as minority positions. <em>Jesus Undefeated</em> is an eye-opening examination of all three views of the afterlife and a God who is even more loving than we dare imagine.

When the Connie<br>finally stopped, she was very uncomfortably close to the far end<br>of the runway and her tires were smoking.<br><br>The pilot radioed: &#x201c;National, Howell One on the ground at six<br>past the hour. Request taxi instructions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Howell One, turn and take Taxiway One on your right. Hold<br>there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Howell One understands hold on Taxiway One.&#x201d;<br><br>The Constellation was the finest transport aircraft in the world.<br>It was capable of flying forty passengers in its pressurized cabin<br>higher&#x2014;at an altitude of 35,000 feet&#x2014;and faster&#x2014;it cruised at better<br>than 300 knots&#x2014;and for a longer distance&#x2014;4,300 miles&#x2014;than<br>any other transport aircraft in the world. When National Airport<br>had opened in June 1941, it had been not much more than a pencil<br>sketch in the notebook of legendary aviator Howard Hughes, who<br>owned, among a good deal else, the Lockheed Aircraft Company.<br>Hughes, who had designed the Lockheed P-38 &#x201c;Lightning&#x201d; fighter<br>plane, had decided that if he took his design of the P-38&#x2019;s wing, enlarged<br>it appropriately, put four engines on it, and then married it to<br>a huge, sleek fuselage with an unusual triple-tail design, he would<br>have one hell of an airplane.<br><br>&#x201c;Build it,&#x201d; Hughes ordered. &#x201c;The Air Corps will buy it once they<br>see it. And if they don&#x2019;t, I know at least one airline that will.&#x201d;<br><br>Although the Congress, in its wisdom, had decreed that airlines<br>could not own aircraft manufacturing companies, and vice versa, it<br>was widely believed that Hughes secretly owned TWA, then known<br>as Transcontinental &amp; Western Airlines, and later as Trans-World<br>Airlines.<br><br>No sooner had Howell One stopped on Taxiway One than a<br>small but impressive fleet of vehicles surrounded it. There were four<br>Ford station wagons and two large trucks. On all their doors was the<br>insignia of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There was also a third<br>truck with a crane mounted in its bed, and a black 1942 Buick Road-<br>master. Neither was marked. The Buick had a large chrome object<br>housing a siren and a red light mounted on its left front fender. Finally,<br>there was a truck carrying the logotype of National Airport. It<br>had a stairway mounted in its bed.<br><br>A dozen or more men in business suits and hats and carrying<br>Thompson submachine guns erupted from the station wagons as the<br>truck with the stairs backed up against the Constellation&#x2019;s rear door.<br><br>Two men in business suits got out of the Buick and quickly<br>climbed the stairs up to the fuselage.<br><br>They stood waiting at the top until the door was finally opened.<br><br>A handsome young officer&#x2014;blond, six-foot-one, 212 pounds&#x2014;<br>stood in the doorway. He was wearing an olive drab woolen &#x201c;Ike&#x201d;<br>jacket and trousers. The jacket&#x2019;s insignia identified him as a second<br>lieutenant of Cavalry. The jacket was unbuttoned, and his necktie<br>pulled down.<br><br>The two men in suits flashed him looks of surprised disapproval<br>as they pushed past him and entered the cabin.<br><br>The cabin looked more like a living room pictured in Architectural<br>Digest than the interior of a passenger aircraft. Instead of rows<br>of seats, there were leather upholstered armchairs and couches scattered<br>along its length. There was a desk and two tables. A full bar<br>was at the front of the cabin. The floor was lushly carpeted.<br><br>Seated in armchairs were three people: a tall, sharp-featured, elegantly<br>tailored septuagenarian; a stocky, short-haired blond woman<br>in her late forties; and an attractive, tanned, and athletic-looking<br>young woman of about twenty.<br><br>They were, respectively, Cletus Marcus Howell, president and<br>chairman of the board of the Howell Petroleum Corporation; his<br>daughter-in-law, Martha Williamson Howell; and her daughter&#x2014;the<br>old man&#x2019;s granddaughter&#x2014;Marjorie.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Assistant Deputy Director Kelly of the FBI,&#x201d; the older of the<br>two men who had come into the cabin announced. He was in his<br>fifties, wore spectacles, and had a short haircut. &#x201c;Welcome to Washington.&#x201d;<br><br>No one responded.<br><br>&#x201c;Where is the officer-in-charge?&#x201d; Kelly asked.<br><br>The old man pointed to the young officer standing at the door.<br><br>&#x201c;You just walked past him,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I asked for the officer-in-charge, sir,&#x201d; Kelly snapped.<br><br>&#x201c;Sonny,&#x201d; the old man said, &#x201c;I hate to rain on your parade, but if<br>that FBI army you have with you was intended to dazzle me, it has<br>failed to do so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dad!&#x201d; the older woman said warningly.<br><br>Her daughter smiled.<br><br>There came the sound of a siren, and then the squealing of brakes,<br>and finally the faint sound of car doors slamming closed.<br><br>A moment later, three men came into the cabin.<br><br>One wore the uniform of a rear admiral. Another, an Army brigadier<br>general, was in &#x201c;pinks and greens&#x201d;&#x2014;a green tunic with pink<br>trousers. The third, a colonel, wore an Army olive drab uniform.<br><br>The colonel stopped just inside the door to both shake the hand<br>of the young officer, then affectionately pat his shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;You done real good, Jimmy,&#x201d; Colonel Robert Mattingly said.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, sir,&#x201d; Second Lieutenant James D. Cronley Jr. replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Admiral,&#x201d; Kelly said.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing here, Kelly?&#x201d; Rear Admiral Sidney W.<br>Souers, U.S. Navy, demanded coldly.<br><br>&#x201c;Self-evidently,&#x201d; Kelly announced, &#x201c;the FBI is here to guarantee<br>the security of the cargo aboard this aircraft until it can be placed in<br>the hands of the Manhattan Project.&#x201d;<br><br>The door to the cockpit opened and a man wearing an airline-<br>type uniform stepped into the cabin. His tunic carried the four<br>golden stripes of a captain.<br><br>Admiral Souers turned to him.<br><br>&#x201c;Any problems, Ford?&#x201d;<br><br>The &#x201c;captain,&#x201d; who was in fact U.S. Navy Commander Richard<br>W. Ford, came to attention.<br><br>&#x201c;None, Admiral,&#x201d; he said.<br>Souers turned to Kelly.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you for your interest, Mr. Kelly. You and your people<br>may go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Admiral, the FBI will stay here until the cargo is in the hands of<br>the Manhattan Project.&#x201d;<br>Souers gestured toward the man in pink and greens.<br>&#x201c;This is General Tomlinson of the Manhattan Project, Mr. Kelly.<br><br>You may report to Mr. Hoover, if you are here at his orders, that you<br>witnessed my turning over of the cargo to the Manhattan Project.&#x201d;<br>Kelly, white-faced, didn&#x2019;t reply.<br>&#x201c;Are you going to leave, taking your people with you, Mr. Kelly?<br><br>Or am I going to have to go down to my car, get on the radio, wake<br>the President up, explain the situation to him and ask him to call<br>Director Hoover and tell him to tell you your presence here is not<br>required?&#x201d;<br><br>Kelly turned on his heels, made an impatient gesture for the man<br>with him to follow, and left the cabin.<br>Souers shook his head as he looked away from the door.<br>&#x201c;How did those sonsofbitches manage to beat us here?&#x201d; he asked<br>rhetorically. He then quickly added, &#x201c;Pardon the language, ladies.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My daughter-in-law and granddaughter have heard the word before,&#x201d;<br>Cletus Marcus Howell said.<br>&#x201c;Mattingly, do you think Hoover has someone in my office?&#x201d;<br><br>Souers asked.<br>Mattingly shrugged. &#x201c;Sir, I would not like to think so. But . . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Admiral,&#x201d; Commander Ford said, &#x201c;the FBI must have had people<br>at the airport in Miami . . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Where you refueled,&#x201d; Souers instantly picked up his thought.<br><br>&#x201c;With orders to keep an eye out for a civilian Constellation coming<br>from South America.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And they called Washington,&#x201d; Mattingly added. &#x201c;When they<br>learned you had filed a nonstop flight plan to National.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And instead of calling me,&#x201d; Souers concluded, &#x201c;the FBI&#x2014;<br>probably J. Edgar himself&#x2014;decided to meet the plane here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; General Tomlinson asked.<br><br>&#x201c;J. Edgar is very good at turning any situation so that it shines a<br>flattering light on the FBI,&#x201d; Souers said.<br><br>He turned and walked back to Second Lieutenant Cronley.<br><br>&#x201c;I have a message for you, son, from President Truman,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quote Well done unquote.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The President also said he wants to see you. That won&#x2019;t happen<br>today, but when it does, I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if he said you can<br>replace your golden bar with a silver one. But . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Souers stopped as a colonel in an olive drab uniform with Corps<br>of Engineers insignia appeared in the doorway.<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, Broadhead,&#x201d; General Tomlinson said. &#x201c;Come in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Admiral Souers,&#x201d; Tomlinson said, &#x201c;this is Colonel Broadhead,<br>who will take charge of the cargo.&#x201d;<br><br>Souers nodded, and then asked of Cronley, &#x201c;Where is it, son?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the cargo hold, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How hot is it?&#x201d; Colonel Broadhead asked.<br><br>Commander Ford answered for him.<br><br>&#x201c;There are six packages, Colonel. Each weighing a little over<br>two hundred pounds. They&#x2019;re roped so as to be manhandle-able.<br><br>Each came with two lead blankets, each weighing about a hundred<br>pounds. With the blankets off, my Geiger counter indicated significant,<br>but not life-threatening, radiation within a two-hour period.<br>With the lead blankets in place, the counter shows only insignificant<br>radiation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are?&#x201d; Broadhead asked.<br><br>Ford looked to Souers for permission to answer the question.<br>Souers nodded, just perceptibly.<br><br>&#x201c;Commander Richard Ford, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Broadhead then said, &#x201c;Where did you first put the Geiger counter<br>to it, Commander? On the submarine?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Colonel,&#x201d; Souers snapped, &#x201c;who told you anything about a submarine?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Admiral,&#x201d; General Tomlinson put in, &#x201c;Colonel Broadhead has<br>worked for me in the Manhattan Project for three years. He has all<br>the necessary security clearances.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very nice, General,&#x201d; Souers said unpleasantly. &#x201c;But my<br>question to the colonel with all the necessary security clearances was<br>&#x2018;Who said something&#x2014;anything&#x2014;to him about a submarine?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; Broadhead said, &#x201c;one of my duties at the Manhattan Project<br>was to keep an eye on the German efforts in that area. I knew they<br>had some uranium oxide&#x2014;from the Belgian Congo&#x2014;and I heard<br>about the missing German U-boats. When I heard that the OSS was<br>about to turn over to us a half ton of it that they&#x2019;d acquired in Argentina,<br>it seemed to me the most logical place for the OSS to have gotten<br>it was from one of the missing U-boats.&#x201d;<br><br>Souers went on: &#x201c;And did you share this assumption of yours,<br>Colonel, with a bunch of other colonels&#x2014;all with the necessary security<br>clearances&#x2014;while you were sitting around having a beer?&#x201d;<br><br>Broadhead, sensing where the line of questioning was headed, replied,<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir. I&#x2019;m afraid I did.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not that it excuses you in any way, Colonel,&#x201d; Souers said icily,<br>&#x201c;but you&#x2019;re just one of a great many stupid senior sonsof . . . officers<br>with all the necessary security clearances who think it&#x2019;s perfectly all<br>right to share anything they know with anyone else who has such<br>clearances. Now do you take my point? Or do I have to order you not<br>to share with anyone anything you&#x2019;ve seen or heard here today or any<br>assumptions you may make from what you have seen or heard?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, I take your point.&#x201d;<br><br>Souers let the exchange sink in for a very long twenty seconds,<br>and then ordered, &#x201c;Ford, answer the colonel&#x2019;s question.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When Cronley seized the cargo, sir,&#x201d; Ford said, &#x201c;he did not have<br>a Geiger counter device.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;May I ask who Cronley is? And why he didn&#x2019;t have a radiation<br>detection device?&#x201d;<br><br>Admiral Souers turned to Cronley. &#x201c;Son, I&#x2019;m going to give Colonel<br>Broadhead the benefit of the doubt, meaning I am presuming<br>that he has a reason beyond idle curiosity in asking it. Therefore, you<br>may answer those questions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Cronley said, then looked at Broadhead. &#x201c;Sir, I&#x2019;m Second<br>Lieutenant James D. Cronley Junior. The first Geiger counter I<br>ever saw was the one Commander Ford used on the . . . packages that<br>I took off . . . wherever they were and gave to him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I predict a great military career for this fine young officer,&#x201d; Admiral<br>Souers said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure everyone noticed that he didn&#x2019;t say &#x2018;submarine&#x2019;<br>or &#x2018;U-boat&#x2019; or &#x2018;uranium oxide&#x2019; even once.&#x201d;<br><br>Souers let that sink in for another ten seconds, and then went on:<br>&#x201c;Now my curiosity is aroused. Why did you want to know, Broadhead,<br>if the Geiger counter had been used on . . . wherever these<br>packages were when Cronley seized them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, I was hoping that someone looked for radiation that might<br>have leaked from the packages while they were on the sub&#x2014;&#x201d; He<br>stopped.<br><br>&#x201c;Now that the cat&#x2019;s out of the bag, Colonel,&#x201d; Souers said, &#x201c;you<br>can say &#x2018;submarine.&#x2019; You can even say &#x2018;U-boat&#x2019; and &#x2018;uranium oxide.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Souers looked at Cletus Marcus Howell, who was grinning widely.<br><br>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t think this is funny, Mr. Howell,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;That was a smile of approval, Admiral. From one mean sonofabitch<br>to another.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dad, for God&#x2019;s sake!&#x201d; Martha Howell said.<br><br>&#x201c;I will take that as a compliment, Mr. Howell,&#x201d; Souers said.<br><br>&#x201c;It was intended as one,&#x201d; the old man said.<br><br>Souers turned to Broadhead.<br><br>&#x201c;You think the submarine may be hot, Broadhead?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s possible, sir. The uranium oxide was on the submarine<br>for a couple of months, maybe even longer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mattingly, get that word to Frade just as soon as we&#x2019;re finished<br>here,&#x201d; Souers ordered. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want to sterilize half the brighter<br>officers of the Armada Argentina, do we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Colonel Mattingly said, smiling. &#x201c;And no, sir, we certainly<br>wouldn&#x2019;t want to do that.&#x201d;<br><br>Second Lieutenant Cronley chuckled.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand that,&#x201d; Cletus Marcus Howell said.<br><br>&#x201c;Possibly, Dad,&#x201d; his daughter-in-law said, &#x201c;because you&#x2019;re not supposed<br>to. It&#x2019;s none of your business.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Actually, with apologies to the ladies, I was being crude in order<br>not to have to say &#x2018;suffer radiation poisoning,&#x2019; &#x201d; Souers said. &#x201c;And,<br>ma&#x2019;am, the President ordered me to answer any questions Mr. Howell<br>might have.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought I told you, Martha,&#x201d; the old man said, &#x201c;that ole Harry<br>and I have the honor to be Thirty-third Degree Masons. We can<br>trust one another.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;May I ask who &#x2018;Frade&#x2019; is?&#x201d; Broadhead said. &#x201c;And if he&#x2019;s qualified<br>to conduct an examination of this kind?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, Colonel, you may not. You don&#x2019;t have the Need to Know,&#x201d;<br>Souers said. &#x201c;Are you and General Tomlinson about ready to get the<br>cargo moving?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At your orders, Admiral,&#x201d; Tomlinson said.<br><br>&#x201c;Then may I suggest you get going?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Show them how to get into the cargo bay, Ford.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, aye, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Cronley made a mov...</p><h2>The Herbal Handbook for Homesteaders: Farmed and Foraged Herbal Remedies and Recipes</h2><p><b>Let&nbsp;<i>The Herbal Handbook for Homesteaders</i>&nbsp;be your helpful compendium of&nbsp;herbal information and&nbsp;recipes for building health and tending to minor ailments out on the homestead.&nbsp;</b><br><br> When you&#x2019;re a homesteader, you face many challenges: from a simple cold, to an earache in your child, fleas on the&nbsp;dog, or worms in your goat.

An outbreak of insanity swept across the planet, turning millions of people into the scarred homicidal maniacs known as &#x201c;the Crossed.&#x201d; For one small band of survivors, the discovery of a starving, injured man in the desert seems like an unexpected blessing. He knows where they could be safe: the location of the last holdout of the scientific community, where the military offers protection and the cure to the Crossed plague is being developed.

Mocked and scorned by his contemporaries, Lay was unflinching in his opposition to slavery, often performing colorful guerrilla theater to shame slave masters, insisting that human bondage violated the fundamental principles of Christianity. He drew on his ideals to create a revolutionary way of life, one that embodied the proclamation &#x201c;no justice, no peace.&#x201d;<br><br>Lay was born in 1682 in Essex, England. His philosophies, employments, and places of residence&#x2014;spanning England, Barbados, Philadelphia, and the open seas&#x2014;were markedly diverse over the course of his life. He worked as a shepherd, glove maker, sailor, and bookseller. His worldview was an astonishing combination of Quakerism, vegetarianism, animal rights, opposition to the death penalty, and abolitionism.<br><br>While in Abington, Philadelphia, Lay lived in a cave-like dwelling surrounded by a library of two hundred books, and it was in this unconventional abode where he penned a fiery and controversial book against bondage, which Benjamin Franklin published in 1738. Always in motion and ever confrontational, Lay maintained throughout his life a steadfast opposition to slavery and a fierce determination to make his fellow Quakers denounce it, which they finally began to do toward the end of his life.<br><br>With passion and historical rigor, Rediker situates Lay as a man who fervently embodied the ideals of democracy and equality as he practiced a unique concoction of radicalism nearly three hundred years ago. Rediker resurrects this forceful and prescient visionary, who speaks to us across the ages and whose innovative approach to activism is a gift, transforming how we consider the past and how we might imagine the future.</p><p><b>Marcus Rediker</b> is Distinguished Professor of Atlantic History at the University of Pittsburgh and Senior Research Fellow at the Coll�ge d&#x2019;�tudes mondiales in Paris.

Researchers claim they could have flown only if the air had contained more oxygen than today -<br>probably as much as 35 per cent.

High oxygen levels may also explain the global firestorm that contributed to the<br>demise of the dinosaurs after the asteroid impact.<br> <br>The strange and profound effects that oxygen has had on the evolution of life pose a riddle, which this book<br>sets out to answer. Oxygen is a toxic gas. Divers breathing pure oxygen at depth suffer from convulsions<br>and lung injury. Fruit flies raised at twice normal atmospheric levels of oxygen live half as long as their<br>siblings. Reactive forms of oxygen, known as free radicals, are thought to cause ageing in people. Yet if<br>atmospheric oxygen reached 35 per cent in the Carboniferous, why did it promote exuberant growth,<br>instead of rapid ageing and death?<br> <br><em>Oxygen</em> takes the reader on an enthralling journey, as gripping as a thriller, as it unravels the unexpected<br>ways in which oxygen spurred the evolution of life and death. The book explains far more than the size of<br>ancient insects: it shows how oxygen underpins the origin of biological complexity, the birth of photosynthesis, the sudden evolution of animals, the need for two sexes, the accelerated ageing of cloned animals like Dolly the sheep, and the surprisingly long lives of bats and birds. <br> <br>Drawing on this grand evolutionary canvas, <em>Oxygen</em> offers fresh perspectives on our own lives and deaths,<br>explaining modern killer diseases, why we age, and what we can do about it. Advancing revelatory new ideas,<br>following chains of evidence, the book ranges through many disciplines, from environmental sciences to<br>molecular medicine.

He was awarded the first Provost's Venture Research Prize in the Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment at University College London, where he is now a Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry. Dr Lane's research deals with evolutionary biochemistry and bioenergetics, focusing on the origin of life and the evolution of complex cells. Dr Lane was a founding member of the UCL Consortium for Mitochondrial Research, and is leading the UCL Research Frontiers Origins of Life programme. He was awarded the 2011 BMC Research Award for Genetics, Genomics, Bioinformatics and Evolution, and the 2015 Biochemical Society Award for his sustained and diverse contribution to the molecular life sciences and the public understanding of science. His books include <em>Oxygen: The Molecule that Made the World</em> (OUP, 2002), and <em>Power, Sex, Suicide:</em> <em>Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life</em> (OUP, 2005).<br>Nick Lane, the author of Oxygen, studied biochemistry at the University of London and did his doctoral research on oxygen free radicals at the Royal Free Hospital in London, but then left science to become the director of a multimedia company involved to a certain extent in medical education. His background suffuses this book, both for better and for worse. Apart from the first chapter, which is cast in a style approaching the juvenile, the book is very well written and easy to read. Lane makes his points clearly, and his lines of reasoning are well developed. The first half of the book is a very interesting and well-thought-out analysis of evolution, starting from the Archean eon and carrying on through the appearance of multicellular eukaryotes, such as humans. There is some awkward writing: "oxygen-hating" this and that, "first ever ice age," and a strained analogy about opinionated newspaper proprietors. Early in the book there are three or four statements that look like errors, but they are corrected later in the book. Of considerable interest, however, are Lane's remarks about chlorophyll arising from purple bacteria. Even more interesting is his comment to the effect that the oxygen-evolving complex in plants arose from an adaptation of catalase. He astutely points out that Fridovich's discovery of superoxide dismutase was "the most important discovery in modern biology never to win the Nobel Prize," a sentiment with which I heartily concur. The second half of the book begins with an excellent chapter on vitamin C, in which the author appropriately describes the outstanding work of Mark Levine and quotes Linus Pauling: "I would trust the biochemistry of a goat over the advice of a doctor." But subsequently, there is a mistake: Sue-Goo Rhee is referred to as a woman, when in fact he is a man. The rest of the second half, though informative in many places, is chiefly a buildup to the author's own theory -- namely, that aging itself is due exclusively to the damage caused by the leakage of oxygen radicals from aging mitochondria. In the course of the book, Lane takes a couple of shots at scientists for working on little pictures instead of the big picture. He takes little cognizance of the fact that big pictures, including the cause of aging, are made by the assembly of little pictures and that his own theory, probably only in part correct, was derived from many little pictures. He cites a few articles that support his idea but none that oppose it. Despite the inclusion of a small number of references, the book is not a perfect work of scholarship. But it is not meant to be one. It is a thought-provoking popularization of evolution and oxygen biochemistry, and I'm glad I read it. Its shortcomings notwithstanding, I can recommend the book strongly because of its informational content and its breezy and accessible style. It has to be read, though, with eyes open. <i>Bernard M.

Whether they are arguing a murder case or a complex financial securities case, they can capably explain a chain of events to judges and juries so that they understand them. The best lawyers are also able to construct narratives that have an emotional impact on their intended audiences. But what is a narrative, and how can lawyers go about constructing one? How does one transform a cold presentation of facts into a seamless story that clearly and compellingly takes readers not only from point A to point B, but to points C, D, E, F, and G as well? In <em>Storytelling for Lawyers</em>, Phil Meyer explains how. He begins with a pragmatic theory of the narrative foundations of litigation practice and then applies it to a range of practical illustrative examples: briefs, judicial opinions and oral arguments. Intended for legal practitioners, teachers, law students, and even interdisciplinary academics, the book offers a basic yet comprehensive explanation of the central role of narrative in litigation. The book also offers a narrative tool kit that supplements the analytical skills traditionally emphasized in law school as well as practical tips for practicing attorneys that will help them craft their own legal stories.<br></p><p><br><strong>Philip N.

You <em>can</em> teach metacognition to your students, so why wouldn't you? This book shows you how.</p><p>Metacognition is a tool that helps students unlock their brain's amazing power and take control of their learning. Educational researchers and professional developers Donna Wilson and Marcus Conyers have been exploring and using the explicit teaching of metacognition for years, and in this book they share a practical way to teach preK&#x2013;12 students how to <em>drive their brains</em> by promoting the following practices:</p><ul><li>Adopt an optimistic outlook toward learning,</li><li>Set goals, </li><li>Focus their attention, </li><li>Monitor their progress, and </li><li>Engage in practices that enhance cognitive flexibility.</li></ul><p></p><p>Wilson and Conyers explain metacognition and how it equips students to meet today's rigorous education standards. They present a unique blend of useful metaphors, learning strategies, and instructional tips you can use to teach your students to be the boss of their brains. Sample lessons show these ideas in a variety of classroom settings, and sections on professional practice help you incorporate these tools (and share them with colleagues and parents) so that you are teaching <em>for</em> and <em>with</em> metacognition.</p></p><p><p><b>Donna Wilson</b>, leader of the academic team at BrainSMART and the Center for Innovative Education and Prevention, is an educational and school psychologist and former teacher.

This is a practical guide to capturing the candid moments that reveal life at its most dramatic, absurd, or beautiful.

A guide to equipment and technical skills leads into lessons in finding inspiration, developing projects, and composing different subjects and scenes&#x2014;laying the foundations for you to impose your personality on your photography and develop your own distinctive style.

Using both internal data from the gospels themselves and an exhaustive and careful examination of the statements of the early church fathers, Dr. Black places each gospel in the context of the early development of Christianity.</p> <p>Though Markan priority is the dominant position still in Biblical scholarship, Dr. Black argues that this position is not based on the best evidence available, that the internal evidence is often given more weight than it deserves and alternative explanations are dismissed or ignored.

Could time run backwards? Is the universe infinite or does it have boundaries? These are just some of the questions considered in an internationally acclaimed masterpiece by one of the world&#39;s greatest thinkers. It begins by reviewing the great theories of the cosmos from Newton to Einstein, before delving into the secrets which still lie at the heart of space and time, from the Big Bang to black holes, via spiral galaxies and strong theory. To this day &#34;A Brief History of Time&#34; remains a staple of the scientific canon, and its succinct and clear language continues to introduce millions to the universe and its wonders.</p><p>Stephen Hawking, one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists in history, wrote the modern classic <i>A Brief History of Time</i> to help nonscientists understand the questions being asked by scientists today: Where did the universe come from? How and why did it begin? Will it come to an end, and if so, how? Hawking attempts to reveal these questions (and where we're looking for answers) using a minimum of technical jargon. Among the topics gracefully covered are gravity, black holes, the Big Bang, the nature of time, and physicists' search for a grand unifying theory. This is <i>deep</i> science; these concepts are so vast (or so tiny) as to cause vertigo while reading, and one can't help but marvel at Hawking's ability to synthesize this difficult subject for people not used to thinking about things like alternate dimensions. The journey is certainly worth taking, for, as Hawking says, the reward of understanding the universe may be a glimpse of "the mind of God." <i>--Therese Littleton</i>"A Brief History of Time, published in 1988, was a landmark volume in science writing and in world-wide acclaim and popularity, with more than 9 million copies in print globally. The original edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the ensuing years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic world--observations that have confirmed many of Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book. <br>Now a decade later, this edition updates the chapters throughout to document those advances, and also includes an entirely new chapter on Wormholes and Time Travel and a new introduction.

There is no way around the fact that the consumption of meat, eggs, the variety of products made from dairy, and foods containing toxic chemicals and refined ingredients trigger the most common diseases afflicting humans. While we remain fearful of nuclear accidents, wars, floods, fires, tornadoes, typhoons, hurricanes, earthquakes, and car crashes, the truth is that the vast majority of people in commercialized civilization are more likely to die from the symptoms resulting from their dependence on prescription drugs, living a toxic lifestyle, and making poor dietary choices. Chief among those bad choices are eating meat, dairy, eggs, refined and fatty foods, and foods containing synthetic chemicals. Meat, eggs, and dairy products are not ideal food sources for humans. We have simply been lied to by the multi-billion-dollar industries that are responsible for producing these low-quality foods, as they continue to profit from products that are the result of the mass-breeding, mistreatment, and killing of harmless, sentient beings that can feel pain just as much as we can. The truth is that eating meat, dairy, eggs, and refined and chemically-altered foods is deleterious to our health. The common degenerative and chronic diseases we are afflicted with today are directly linked with the food choices we make. By eating more raw fruits and vegetables, removing animal products and junk foods from our diet, and making healthier lifestyle choices we will soon find that we no longer need the vast amount of what we call &#x2018;healthcare'. We will drastically reduce the costs associated with surgery and our dependence on toxic, synthetic chemical drugs. Incidence of heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, arthritis, cancer, and obesity will plunge, and we &#x2013; and Earth &#x2013; will be much healthier. Rather than choosing to be ignorant of the truth, it is time for us to take back our health, empower ourselves, gain compassion, and quit contributing to these acts of cruelty we call &#x2018;animal farming'. Doing so will greatly reduce our use of fossil fuels that are destroying life on Earth. Using medical studies, and reliable scientific research, the author provides strong evidence that the link between nutrition and disease is more paramount than we once believed it to be. This book exposes the truth, and will guide you on your journey to take back your health.</p><p>Jesse Jacoby is a dedicated raw foodist who has devoted his life to the raw food movement.

She was the wife of Henry VII and mother of Henry VIII.</b>&nbsp;</b><br><br>Many are familiar with the story of the much-married King Henry VIII of England and the celebrated reign of his daughter, Elizabeth I. But it is often forgotten that the life of the first Tudor queen, Elizabeth of York, Henry&#x2019;s mother and Elizabeth&#x2019;s grandmother, spanned one of England&#x2019;s most dramatic and perilous periods. Now <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author and acclaimed historian Alison Weir presents the first modern biography of this extraordinary woman, whose very existence united the realm and ensured the survival of the Plantagenet bloodline.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her birth was greeted with as much pomp and ceremony as that of a male heir. The first child of King Edward IV, Elizabeth enjoyed all the glittering trappings of royalty. But after the death of her father; the disappearance and probable murder of her brothers&#x2014;the Princes in the Tower; and the usurpation of the throne by her calculating uncle Richard III, Elizabeth found her world turned upside-down: She and her siblings were declared bastards.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Richard&#x2019;s wife, Anne Neville, was dying, there were murmurs that the king sought to marry his niece Elizabeth, knowing that most people believed her to be England&#x2019;s rightful queen. Weir addresses Elizabeth&#x2019;s possible role in this and her covert support for Henry Tudor, the exiled pretender who defeated Richard at the Battle of Bosworth and was crowned Henry VII, first sovereign of the House of Tudor. Elizabeth&#x2019;s subsequent marriage to Henry united the houses of York and Lancaster and signaled the end of the Wars of the Roses. For centuries historians have asserted that, as queen, she was kept under Henry&#x2019;s firm grasp, but Weir shows that Elizabeth proved to be a model consort&#x2014;pious and generous&#x2014;who enjoyed the confidence of her husband, exerted a tangible and beneficial influence, and was revered by her son, the future King Henry VIII. <br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing from a rich trove of historical records, Weir gives a long overdue and much-deserved look at this unforgettable princess whose line descends to today&#x2019;s British monarch&#x2014;a woman who overcame tragedy and danger to become one of England&#x2019;s most beloved consorts.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Elizabeth of York</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Weir tells Elizabeth&#x2019;s story well. . . .

She lives in Surrey, England, with her husband.1<br><br>&#x201c;The Most Illustrious Maid of York&#x201d;<br><br>The royal palace of Westminster extended along the Thames shore, southwest of the City of London. A royal residence had stood on this site opposite Westminster Abbey since the sainted King Edward the Confessor had rebuilt both in the eleventh century, and the magnificent Westminster Hall had been completed by William II in 1099; in the late fourteenth century, Richard II increased the height of its walls and added the splendid oak hammer-beam roof. The sprawling palace in which the Queen was to be confined was the work of successive medieval kings, and the chief seat of royal government until much of it was destroyed by fire in 1512. Parliament often met within its walls, usually in the Painted Chamber, the White Hall, or St. Stephen&#x2019;s Chapel. Westminster Hall was used for state occasions and ceremonies, and also for coronation banquets. Daily, it was a hive of industry, housing the busy law courts and stalls selling books and other goods.<br><br>The rambling old palace was much in need of upgrading, and Edward IV had set about converting part of it into new royal lodgings, which Elizabeth of York would come to know very well. They included a privy kitchen for the preparation of royal meals, a wardrobe for the storage of royal possessions, and something very traditional in royal domestic arrangements: separate ranges of private apartments for the King and Queen.<br><br>The creation of a new &#x201c;Queen&#x2019;s side&#x201d; for Elizabeth Wyde�ville, which was begun in 1464, may have come about because the King&#x2019;s mother, the disapproving Cecily Neville, was living at court and appropriate accommodation was needed for both ladies. The apartments built for Queen Elizabeth included a withdrawing chamber and wardrobe; a great chamber would be added in 1482.1 It was in these new lodgings that the Queen was to bear her child.<br><br>For married women in those days, pregnancy was often an annual event, with all the risks it entailed. Contraception was rudimentary and would not have been practiced by royal couples, for whom a large family meant sons to secure the succession and daughters to forge political marriage alliances. It was a son, naturally, that the King wanted, and although, by medieval custom, male physicians did not attend pregnant women, Dr. Dominic de Sirego, Elizabeth Wyde�ville&#x2019;s physician, was determined to &#x201c;be the first that should bring tidings to the King of the birth of the prince,&#x201d; for messengers conveying such glad news often received &#x201c;great thanks and reward.&#x201d; Only women were allowed into the birth chamber, so when the Queen went into labor, Dr. Sirego had perforce to wait in the &#x201c;second chamber.&#x201d; The baby was a girl: &#x201c;this year [1466], the eleventh day of the month of February, was Elizabeth, first child of King Edward, born at Westminster.&#x201d;2 She was the first princess born to an English monarch in over a century.<br><br>The waiting physician, hearing the child cry, &#x201c;knocked or called secretly at the chamber door&#x201d; and asked &#x201c;what the Queen had,&#x201d; whereupon her attendants, much amused, called back, &#x201c;Whatsoever the Queen&#x2019;s Grace hath here within, sure it is that a fool standeth there without!&#x201d; Whereupon Dr. Sirego hastily &#x201c;departed without seeing the King that time.&#x201d;3<br><br>That same month, &#x201c;my Lady Princess&#x201d; was baptized &#x201c;with most solemnity&#x201d; in a new font set up in St. Stephen&#x2019;s Chapel in Westminster Palace by her kinsman, George Neville, Archbishop of York,4 just as if she had been the desired prince. She was given her mother&#x2019;s name; it was a happy coincidence that the Queen had a special devotion for St. Elizabeth.5 The name Elizabeth was not new in the royal line: it had been given to daughters of Henry I and Edward I, and to a granddaughter of Edward III. It had also been borne by Elizabeth de Burgh, the heiress who married Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence (Edward III&#x2019;s second son), and brought the rich Ulster inheritance to the royal House of York.<br><br>Tradition decreed that the King and Queen did not attend the christening, but Edward IV made it the occasion for a show of solidarity, even though the players were privately at odds or disapproved of his marriage. The baby princess&#x2019;s sponsors were her grandmothers, the Duchesses of York and Bedford, and the Earl of Warwick. Walter Blount, Lord Mountjoy, Treasurer of England, received 1,000 marks [�152,250] for his diligence at the baptism, then was promptly told to resign his office to the Queen&#x2019;s father, Lord Rivers.<br><br>The King bought his wife a jeweled ornament costing �125 [�62,550] &#x201c;against the birth of our most dear daughter Elizabeth.&#x201d; Even though she had only borne a daughter, Elizabeth Wyde�ville&#x2019;s churching ceremony that followed in late March was attended by great magnificence. The Queen left her childbed that morning and went to church in stately order, accompanied by many priests bearing relics and by many scholars singing and carrying lights. There followed a great company of ladies and maidens from the country and from London. Then came trumpeters, pipers, and players of stringed instruments. The King&#x2019;s choir followed, forty-two of them, who sang excellently. Then came twenty-four heralds and pursuivants, followed by sixty earls and knights. At last came the Queen, escorted by two dukes. Above her was a canopy. Behind her were her mother and maidens and ladies to the number of sixty. Then the Queen heard the singing of an office. Following the service of purification that marked her return to society after her confinement, &#x201c;she returned to the palace in procession, as before. Then all who had joined the procession remained to eat.&#x201d; So many guests were present&#x2014;clearly a prince had been anticipated&#x2014;that they &#x201c;filled four great rooms&#x201d; of an &#x201c;unbelievably costly apartment.&#x201d;6<br><br>Elizabeth Wyde�ville might have been deemed an unsuitable bride for the King, but she was determined that no one should remember it, and the etiquette that surrounded her on this occasion was rigorous. &#x201c;The Queen sat alone at table on a costly golden chair. The Queen&#x2019;s mother and the King&#x2019;s sister [Anne, Duchess of Exeter] had to stand some distance away. When the Queen spoke with her mother or the King&#x2019;s sister, they knelt down before her until she had drunk water. Not until the first dish was set before the Queen could [they] be seated. The [sixty] ladies and maidens and all who served the Queen at table were of noble birth, and had to kneel so long as the Queen was eating; the meal lasted for three hours. The food which was served to the Queen, the Queen&#x2019;s mother, the King&#x2019;s sister, and others was most costly. Everyone was silent and not a word was spoken.&#x201d; Afterward, no doubt to everyone&#x2019;s relief, there was dancing, with the ladies curtseying elegantly to the silent Queen, and glorious singing by the King&#x2019;s choristers. A foreign observer noted: &#x201c;The courtly reverence paid to the Queen was such as I have never seen elsewhere.&#x201d;7<br><br>Like all babies in those days, the infant princess was swaddled in tight bands with a close-fitting cap on her head, and she would have remained swaddled for the first eight or nine months of her life to ensure that her limbs grew straight. She was assigned a stately household that included a nurse (each of the royal children had a separate nurse) and a wet nurse, for queens did not suckle their children. The household was under the charge of a lady mistress, or governess, Margaret, Lady Berners,8 who received a salary of �100 [�50,000]. Under her were pages of the chamber, a &#x201c;knight of the trencher,&#x201d; and rockers to watch over the princess in her cradle.<br><br>The kingdom into which Elizabeth of York was born was a land of prosperity, according to an Italian observer writing in 1500: &#x201c;The riches of England are greater than those of any other country in Europe. This is owing, in the first place, to the great fertility of the soil, which is such that, with the exception of wine, they import nothing from abroad for their subsistence.&#x201d; The export of tin brought large sums into the realm, &#x201c;but still more do they derive from their extraordinary abundance of wool. And everyone who makes a tour in the island will soon become aware of this great wealth, for there is no small innkeeper, however poor and humble he may be, who does not serve his table with silver dishes and drinking cups, and no one who has not in his house silver plate to the amount of �100 [�50,000]. But above all are their riches displayed in the church treasures . . . You may therefore imagine what the decorations of these enormously rich Benedictine, Carthusian, and Cistercian monasteries must be. These are, indeed, more like baronial palaces than religious houses.&#x201d;9 And all, of course, would be swept away within seventy years of Elizabeth&#x2019;s birth, on the orders of her son. But for now, England was celebrated as &#x201c;the ringing isle&#x201d; because of its many churches, abbeys, and priories.<br><br>Much more of the land was covered by forest and woodland than it is now. The country was largely rural and given over to agriculture; as the Italian perceived, it had become prosperous through the export of wool and, latterly, woolen cloth. The people were often turbulent, unruly, and vociferous&#x2014;especially when it came to new taxes&#x2014;and it was said that while the French vice was lechery, the English vice was treachery. The latter were perceived to be lazy&#x2014;&#x201c;it is received as a prescript that they should sweat by no means&#x201d;&#x2014;and gluttonous: &#x201c;though they live in hovels, they eat like lords.&#x201d; Most people lived in the country, and society was generally localized. It was the upper classes and merchants who traveled.<br><br>Elizabeth would have learned early in life that she was a very special little girl. Her father was the King, whose person was regarded as sacred. Divinely appointed to rule, he had been invested at his coronation with a sanctity that set him apart from ordinary mortals and bestowed on him the grace to govern with a wisdom denied to others. The royal prerogative was believed to be the will of God working through the will of the King.<br><br>The court over which King Edward presided, and in which Elizabeth grew up, was a magnificent one&#x2014;&#x201c;the most splendid court that could be found in all Christendom.&#x201d;10 The royal family was its central focus, so Elizabeth would have grown up with a sense of her importance in the world. It would have seemed a crowded world to a young child&#x2014;Edward IV&#x2019;s household numbered about eight hundred persons or more, not counting the members of his queen&#x2019;s separate establishment. The court was itinerant, with the King dividing his time between a dozen of his palaces (most of them in the Thames Valley), according to the demands of state, the hunting to be had, or the need for cleansing a house after hundreds of courtiers and servants had tested its capacity for drainage to the limits.<br><br>Elizabeth would have become used to travel from infancy. The royal household would regularly wend its cumbersome way about the country, taking with it a long train of servants, carts, and packhorses laden with furniture, tapestries, personal belongings, and state papers, all packed in chests, coffers, and bags. The royal women and children traveled either by barge&#x2014;the Thames being the main highway through London&#x2014;or in covered horse-drawn coaches, like wagons, with four wheels, which could not have been very comfortable, as they were unsprung; or in smaller versions called litters, chariots, or &#x201c;chairs.&#x201d; A household could travel an average of twenty-six miles a day, depending on the state of the roads. Most were little more than tracks, with a few surviving Roman exceptions, and their condition depended on the weather and the public-spiritedness of the parish authorities or landowners who were supposed to maintain them. It was for this reason that royalty often preferred, where possible, to travel by river.<br><br>In his tastes, King Edward followed the dictates of the court of Burgundy, which at that time led the rest of northern Europe in art, architecture, style, dress, manners, and court ceremonial. He understood the value of magnificence that underpinned Burgundian court culture, and spent lavishly on clothing, jewels, plate, and tapestries from the Low Countries, but it was not until later in his reign that he was able to patronize the arts and indulge his passion for building. Today, the Perpendicular-style glory of St. George&#x2019;s Chapel, Windsor, and the great hall at Eltham Palace, bear witness to the largely vanished splendors of his reign.<br><br>Elizabeth grew up to know these places well, especially the Palace of Westminster. Opposite stood Westminster Abbey, where kings were crowned and many of her royal forebears were buried. Elizabeth would have grown up knowing the neighboring City of London well too. &#x201c;All the beauty of this island is confined to London,&#x201d; wrote the anonymous Italian in 1500.11 It was one of the greatest cities in Christendom, prosperous and teeming, its skyline dominated by the soaring Gothic edifice of St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral and the spires of over eighty churches. About 60,000 to 75,000 of England&#x2019;s estimated population of three or four million people lived in the City, which possessed &#x201c;all the advantages to be desired in a maritime town&#x201d; and was a flourishing mercantile center. &#x201c;On the banks of the Thames are enormous warehouses for imported goods; also numerous cranes of remarkable size to unload merchandise from ships . . . Whatever there is in the City, it all belongs to craftsmen and merchants,&#x201d;12 such as would supply Elizabeth with luxury goods all her life.</p><h2>Gaze Into Heaven: Near-Death Experiences in Early Church History</h2><p>Gaze Into Heaven is a compilation of fifty documented near-death experiences of life beyond the veil, drawn from the early history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Treat an earache with sweet oil drops. Wear plant roots to keep from catching colds. Within many African American families, these kinds of practices continue today, woven into the fabric of black culture, often communicated through women. Such folk practices shape the concepts about healing that are diffused throughout African American communities and are expressed in myriad ways, from faith healing to making a mojo.</p> <p>Stephanie Y. Mitchem presents a fascinating study of African American healing. She sheds light on a variety of folk practices and traces their development from the time of slavery through the Great Migrations. She explores how they have continued into the present and their relationship with alternative medicines. Through conversations with black Americans, she demonstrates how herbs, charms, and rituals continue folk healing performances. Mitchem shows that these practices are not simply about healing; they are linked to expressions of faith, delineating aspects of a holistic epistemology and pointing to disjunctures between African American views of wellness and illness and those of the culture of institutional medicine.</p></p><p><p><b>Stephanie Mitchem</b> is associate professor of religious studies and women's studies at the University of South Carolina. She is the author of <i>Introducing Womanist Theology</i>, as well as <i>African American Women Tapping Power and Spiritual Wellness</i>.</p>Mitchem, who teaches religious studies at the University of South Carolina, explores folk healing as a faith expression in black communities. While she includes some of the remedies used by African-Americans (e.g., to lower your blood pressure, put Spanish moss in your drink), her research goes far beyond collecting cures. Indeed, Mitchem argues that for African-Americans healing practices are part of a larger system of meaning, one that is sometimes in conflict with institutionalized medicine. Black folk healing has persisted in part because a racist society has long denied adequate care to black people&#x2014;folk healing, Mitchem persuasively argues, allows African-Americans agency in defining their own bodies, exerting some control over life. But even when African-Americans can find equitable medical care, folk practices will persist because they are life-giving and because they holistically address physical, economic and spiritual needs. Mitchem could have offered a more robust analysis of the commodification of folk medicine&#x2014;she notes that a Detroit Hoodoo 101 class cost $75, but fails to adequately probe the meeting of folk medicine and the marketplace. That omission is a minor flaw in a fascinating study that makes a real contribution to discussions of health, wellness and faith in America. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Agent&#x2019;s Relentless Pursuit of the Nation&#x2019;s Worst Predators</em>, which Rinek wrote with the journalist Marilee Strong, sounds warm and humane, qualities missing from much crime writing. Their book is a professional job, filled with illuminating details about the day-to-day operations of the bureau."</strong></p> <p><strong>&#x2014;<em>New York Times Book Review&nbsp;</em></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>FBI Special Agent Jeff Rinek had a gift for getting child predators to confess. All he had to do was share a piece of his soul . . .</strong></p> <p><em>In the Name of the Children</em> gives an unflinching look at what it's like to fight a never-ending battle against an enemy far more insidious than terrorists: the predators, lurking amongst us, who seek to harm our children.</p> <p>During his 30-year career with the FBI, Jeff Rinek worked hundreds of investigations involving crimes against children: from stranger abduction to serial homicide to ritualized sexual abuse. Those who do this kind of work are required to plumb the depths of human depravity, to see things no one should ever have to see&#x2014;and once seen can never forget. There is no more important&#x2014;or more brutal&#x2014;job in law enforcement, and few have been more successful than Rinek at solving these sort of cases.</p> <p>Most famously, Rinek got Cary Stayner to confess to all four of the killings known as the Yosemite Park Murders, an accomplishment made more extraordinary by the fact that the FBI nearly pinned the crimes on the wrong suspects. Rinek's recounting of the confession and what he learned about Stayner provides perhaps the most revelatory look ever inside the psyche of a serial killer and a privileged glimpse into the art of interrogation.</p> <p><em>In the Name of the Children</em> takes readers into the trenches of real-time investigations where every second counts and any wrong decision or overlooked fact can have tragic repercussions. Rinek offers an insider's perspective of the actual case agents and street detectives who are the boots on the ground in this war at home. By placing us inside the heart and mind of a rigorously honest and remarkably self-reflective investigator, we will see with our own eyes what it takes&#x2014;and what it costs&#x2014;to try to keep our children safe and to bring to justice those who prey on society's most vulnerable victims.</p> <p>With each chapter dedicated to a real case he worked, <em>In the Name of the Children</em> also explores the evolution of Rinek as a Special Agent&#x2014;whose unorthodox, empathy-based approach to interviewing suspects made him extraordinarily successful in obtaining confessions&#x2014;and the toll it took to have such intimate contact with child molesters and murderers. Beyond exploring the devastating impact of these unthinkable crimes on the victims and their families, this book offers an unprecedented look at how investigators and their loved ones cope while living in the specter of so much suffering.</p></p><p><p><strong>Jeffey Rinek</strong> served 30 years as a Special Agent with the FBI primarily investigating cases of missing and murdered children and is internationally renowned for obtaining a surprise confession from serial killer Cary Stayner to the brutal slayings of four women and girls known as the Yosemite Park Murders.

No one in law enforcement has ever written with such unvarnished honesty about what it takes to bring down those who prey on kids. Jeff Rinek&#x2019;s insights into the motives and modus operandi of sex offenders and his approach to getting killers like serial sex slayer Cary Stayner to confess should be mandatory reading not just for those in law enforcement but also for everyone who cares about the safety of our children.

Most difficult are the examples that run seven moves and more; some of these may even stump an ordinary master.<br><br>Most of all, this a book of combinative ideas, all designed to enhance your arsenal of weapons. The first step toward mastery is to become familiar with the different types of tactical motifs. The second step is to study a great many examples of these tactical themes.

Why? The New Testament Gospels, as they are written, depend on Daniel 7. Jesus referenced this chapter far more than any other to reveal Himself as the divine Human and to declare His gospel. Jesus&#x2019; first-century audience understood His message, but we have lost sight of the way Jesus presented His gospel. Our understanding of Jesus, our grasp of the biblical story, and our ability to clearly communicate the gospel have been seriously hindered by our not fully understanding one particular chapter in the Bible.Daniel 7 is not just an end-time chapter. Based on Jesus&#x2019; words, Daniel 7 is a gospel-centered chapter and perhaps the premier summary of Jesus&#x2019; majesty.If we do not know this chapter, we cannot fully grasp the gospel. Jesus commissioned us to carry the message found in this chapter to every people, but we cannot carry what we do not understand. Let Daniel open your eyes to the gospel as Jesus proclaimed it.</p><p><p>Rarely in the history of theological writing and biblical exegesis has a book emerged that makes its point so clearly, yet one that is most foundational to the content of the Gospel: namely, that Jesus wanted His people Israel and the nations of the world to recognize Him as "the Son of Man" as announced in Daniel 7 and repeated some 78 times in the Gospels with an added 53 associated themes that also came from Daniel 7. I was personally enriched and corrected as this title of <em>The Son of Man</em> was biblically shown to take precedence over all other titles and functions of our Lord in Scripture, such as <em>Messiah</em> or the <em>Son of God</em>. Surely, this book will offer one of the richest rewards for all who will carefully follow the truth of this title from Daniel 7 as demonstrated by Jesus. I can hardly find the adequate words to commend this book as highly as I think it should be received and shared broadly in our day and age.</p><p><strong>Dr. Walter C. Kaiser, Jr., </strong><em>President Emeritus</em>, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, Hamilton, MA</p><p>There is absolutely nothing greater in the Christian life than when the Holy Spirit reveals Jesus Christ through the Word of God. One phrase from one verse can open up a door of revelation where all you can say is, "I've never seen this before," "This is absolutely astounding," or "This changes everything." I believe that the revelation of Jesus as T<em>he Son of Man </em>changes everything. I watched how the Holy Spirit took this phrase out of Daniel 7 and began to take Samuel on a journey into the ocean of revelation and implication surrounding this phrase. Samuel provoked me because I had never seen it before. He challenged me because the Holy Spirit was calling me to go deeper. And He taught me and gave me insight and understanding into one of the most overlooked, misunderstood, and yet absolutely critical revelations for the end-time church. In 1 Peter 1, we read that the prophets of old inquired and searched carefully of that which was coming, and I believe Samuel is in the same spirit as he has written this book. This book will become one of the central books to the church in the coming days. I cannot overemphasize our need to give ourselves to it today.</p><p><strong>Corey Russell</strong>, Author and Speaker, Dallas, TX</p><p>Contemporary scholarship on the Synoptic Gospels asserts that the book of Daniel was very important for the first century and for the self-understanding of Yeshua and the Synoptic Gospel writers. Daniel 7 is especially emphasized. These texts give us a window into the important Son of Man idea and the Deity of Yeshua. Orthodox writer Daniel Boyarin from the University of California at Berkeley has emphasized this. Now, Samuel Whitefield has written an important book that greatly expands our understanding of Daniel 7 as an interpretive key. I consider this book a must read!</p><p><strong>Daniel Juster</strong>, Restoration from Zion of Tikkun International</p><p>For as long as I've known my friend Samuel, he's always been the guy that's looking at things from an angle that you didn't see, but then after he unpacks what he's observing, I always think to myself: <em>Why didn't I see that? It was sitting right in front of me!</em> Samuel's new book, <em>Son of Man: The Gospel of Daniel 7</em>, read exactly this way when I picked it up--a theological adventure of looking at Daniel, Jesus, and the Kingdom of God. At the end of the book, all of these things were clearer and more alive in my mind and my heart than before the reading began. Be prepared to be challenged, stretched, and stirred as God's kingdom comes to light in a fresh way!</p><p><strong>Jim Stern</strong>, <em>Lead Pastor</em>, Destiny Church of St. Louis</p></p><h2>The Legend of the Christmas Cookie: Sharing the True Meaning of Christmas</h2><p><p><em>The Legend of the Christmas Cookie </em>tells the story of a young boy named Jack who learns from his generous mother the story behind the Christmas cookie.

His profound spiritual experiences and penetrating theological vision found complex and often astonishing expression in his unparalleled command of Greek philosophy, making him one of the most challenging and original Christian thinkers of all time. So thoroughly did his thought come to influence the Byzantine theological tradition that it is impossible to trace the subsequent history of Orthodox Christianity without knowledge of his work. The <i>Ambigua</i> (or "Book of Difficulties") is Maximos's greatest philosophical and doctrinal work, in which his daring originality, prodigious talent for speculative thinking, and analytical acumen are on lavish display. In the <i>Ambigua,</i> a broad range of theological topics--cosmology, anthropology, the philosophy of mind and language, allegory, asceticism, and metaphysics--are transformed in a synthesis of Aristotelian logic, Platonic metaphysics, Stoic psychology, and the arithmetical philosophy of a revived Pythagoreanism. The result is a labyrinthine map of the mind's journey to God that figured prominently in the Neoplatonic revival of the Komnenian Renaissance and the Hesychast Controversies of the Late Byzantine period. This remarkable work has never before been available in a critically based edition or English translation.</p><p><p>Nicholas Constas, formerly Associate Professor at the Harvard Divinity School, is a monk at the Simonopetra Monastery, Mt.

His inventive work of the early 1930s helped define the creative potential of modern photography. Following World War II, he helped found the Magnum photo agency, which enabled photojournalists to reach a broad audience through magazines such as <i>Life</i> while retaining control over their work. Cartier-Bresson would go on to produce major bodies of photographic reportage, capturing such events as China during the revolution, the Soviet Union after Stalin's death, the United States in the postwar boom and Europe as its older cultures confronted modern realities. Published to accompany an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, this is the first major publication to make full use of the extensive holdings of the Fondation Cartier-Bresson&#x2015;including thousands of prints and a vast resource of documents relating to the photographer's life and work. The heart of the book surveys Cartier-Bresson's career through 300 photographs divided into 12 chapters. While many of his most famous pictures are included, a great number of images will be unfamiliar even to specialists. A wide-ranging essay by Peter Galassi, Chief Curator of Photography at the Museum, offers an entirely new understanding of Cartier-Bresson's extraordinary career and its overlapping contexts of journalism and art. The extensive supporting material&#x2015;featuring detailed chronologies of the photographer's professional travels and of spreads of his picture stories as they appeared in magazines&#x2015;will revolutionize the study of Cartier-Bresson's work.</p><p></p><h2>Tips : Ideas for Actors</h2><p>Provides 205 tips for refining such acting skills as technique, textual study, transitions, role building, play-writing, and strategy.</p><p>Jon Jory served as the producing director at Actors Theatre of Louisville for thirty-one years, during which time he directed over 140 plays and produced over 1300. Mr. Jory is recognized as a chief innovator and initiator for the American theater during a crucial era of its growth. Throughout his career, Mr. Jory has devoted his energy to the rebirth of the regional repertory and to excellence in all facets of production, but especially to the encouragement of new writers and the production of new American plays. Mr. Jory is himself a published playwright. He now teaches theater at the University of Seattle. Mr. Jory has been responsible for developing the internationally lauded Humana Festival of New American Plays, the SHORTS Festival and the Classics in Context Festival. Through his work at Actors Theatre, he has brought new plays to festivals all over the world. Plays from Actors Theatre directed by Mr. Jory have been seen On- and Off-Broadway, on national television, and in 15 regional theaters in the United States. Mr. Jory has directed and taught in Greece, Canada, Bulgaria, Australia, Hungary, Israel, Ireland, Yugoslavia, Poland, Egypt, and Syria. As a result of these efforts, he and Actors Theatre have received the Margo Jones Award twice for the production of new plays, the Shubert Foundation&#39;s James N. Vaughan Memorial Award for Exceptional Achievement and Contribution to the Development of the Professional Theatre, Carnegie Mellon&#39;s Commitment to Playwriting Award, and a Special Tony Award for Achievement in Regional Theater. Mr. Jory was an honored recipient of the American Theatre Association&#39;s Award for distinguished Service to Theatre, the National Theatre Conference Award, The Southeastern Theatre Conference Distinguished Career Award, and the Milner Person of the Year Award.Jory, whose 31-year tenure as artistic director of the venerable Actors Theatre of Louisville ends this fall when he joins the drama faculty of the University of Washington, has assembled a pastiche of pointers that is a Helpful Hints from Heloise for actors. And when the producer of some 1300 professional works and a leading member of the brain trust behind The Humana Festival, the most significant incubator of new plays in the country, wants to dish on acting, actors listen. Arranged under a dozen major headings that include obligatory sections such as textual study, role building, technique, and strategy, each of the 205 tips is a succinct, one-page chestnut that will benefit actors of all levels. Jory!s advice is both practical and theoretical, pedestrian and elevated. One particularly revelatory tip, Transitions, divulges what Jory the director most closely watches for in auditions. This is the kind of soup-to-nuts guide actors are starving for, and as a result there may be fewer starving actors. Another dead-on entry in Smith and Kraus!s Career Development Series, this should be acquired by all collections supporting the needs of actors."Barry X.

In this book, educators Nancy Frey, Douglas Fisher, and Sandi Everlove show you how to make all group work productive group work: with all students engaged in the academic content and with each other, building valuable social skills, consolidating and extending their knowledge, and increasing their readiness for independent learning.</p><p>The key to getting the most out of group work is to match research-based principles of group work with practical action. Classroom examples across grade levels and disciplines illustrate how to</p><p><br>* Create interdependence and positive interaction<br><br>* Model and guide group work<br><br>* Design challenging and engaging group tasks<br><br>* Ensure group and individual accountability <br><br>* Assess and monitor students' developing understanding (and show them how to do the same)<br><br>* Foster essential interpersonal skills, such as thinking with clarity, listening, giving useful feedback, and considering different points of view.<br></p><p>The authors also address the most frequently asked questions about group work, including the best ways to form groups, accommodate mixed readiness levels, and introduce collaborative learning routines into the classroom. Throughout, they build a case that productive group work is both an essential part of a gradual release of responsibility instructional model and a necessary part of good teaching practice.</p></p><p></p><h2>Young Money: A Powerful 5 Step Money Plan to Financial Success Now (Networlding Leadership Series)</h2><p><b>A better life awaits you when you learn how to think about and see money differently.</b><br><br>Let's face it. &nbsp;We're simply not taught how to manage our money at a young age or how to create wealth by learning about investing. &nbsp;Are you sick and tired of how you loosely save, manage and spend your money?

It was here that Poles, Ukrainians, and Jews all lived side by side in relative harmony. Then came World War II, and three years later the entire Jewish population had been murdered by German and Ukrainian police, while Ukrainian nationalists eradicated Polish residents. In truth, though, this genocide didn&#x2019;t happen so quickly.<br> <br>In <i>Anatomy of a Genocide</i>, Omer Bartov explains that ethnic cleansing doesn&#x2019;t occur as is so often portrayed in popular history, with the quick ascent of a vitriolic political leader and the unleashing of military might. It begins in seeming peace, slowly and often unnoticed, the culmination of pent-up slights and grudges and indignities. The perpetrators aren&#x2019;t just sociopathic soldiers. They are neighbors and friends and family. They are also middle-aged men who come from elsewhere, often with their wives and children and parents, and settle into a life of bourgeois comfort peppered with bouts of mass murder.<br> <br>For more than two decades Bartov, whose mother was raised in Buczacz, traveled extensively throughout the region, scouring archives and amassing thousands of documents rarely seen until now. He has also made use of hundreds of first-person testimonies by victims, perpetrators, collaborators, and rescuers. <i>Anatomy of a Genocide</i> profoundly changes our understanding of the social dynamics of mass killing and the nature of the Holocaust as a whole. Bartov&#x2019;s book isn&#x2019;t just an attempt to understand what happened in the past. It&#x2019;s a warning of how it could happen again, in our own towns and cities&#x2014;much more easily than we might think.</p><p>Omer Bartov is the John P. Birkelund Distinguished Professor of European History at Brown University. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>Anatomy of a Genocide: The Life and Death of a Town Called Buczacz</i>, along with several other well-respected scholarly works on the Holocaust and genocide, including&nbsp;<i>Germany&#x2019;s War and the Holocaust: Disputed Histories</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Erased: Vanishing Traces of Jewish Galicia in Present-Day Ukraine</i>. He has written for&nbsp;<i>The New Republic</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Wall Street Journal, The Nation,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts."Mr. Bartov&#x2019;s anatomy of genocidal destruction is a monument of a different sort. It is an act of filial piety recollecting the blood-soaked homeland of his parents; it is a substantive contribution to the history of ethnic strife and extreme violence; it is a harrowing reminder that brutality and intimacy can combine to destroy individual lives and reshape the destiny of a region and its peoples: history as recollection and as warning."<br> <br>&#x2014;<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"Fascinating...This resonant and cautionary history demonstrates how the peace was incrementally disrupted, as rage accumulated and neighbors and friends felt pitted against one another."<br> <br>&#x2014; Los Angeles Times<br><br>"If you imagined there might be no more to learn, along&nbsp;comes this work of forensic, gripping, original, appalling brilliance."&nbsp;<br> <br> &#x2014; Philippe Sands, author of <i>East West&nbsp;Street: On the Origins of "Genocide" and "Crimes Against Humanity"</i><br><br>"Combines a long historical perspective with an intimate reconstruction of who the perpetrators and victims of the Holocaust had been.

The buttons Laura cherishes the most belonged to her mother&#x2014;a button from her prom dress, a white one off her wedding dress, and a single small button from the nightgown she was wearing on the day she died. When the string breaks, Laura&#x2019;s new stepmother, Jane, is there to comfort Laura and search for a missing button, just as Laura&#x2019;s mother would have done. But it&#x2019;s not the same&#x2014;Jane isn&#x2019;t Mom. In Eve Bunting&#x2019;s moving story, beautifully illustrated by Ted Rand, Laura discovers that a memory string is not just for remembering the past: it&#x2019;s also for recording new memories.</p><p><p>Eve Bunting has written&nbsp;over two hundred&nbsp;books for children, including the Caldecott Medal-winning <i>Smoky Night,</i> illustrated by David Diaz, <i>The Wall</i>,<i> Fly Away Home</i>, and <i>Train to Somewhere</i>. She lives in Southern California.</p><br><br>The late TED&nbsp;RAND&nbsp;was&nbsp;the esteemed illustrator of many picture books, including Eve Bunting's Secret Place and The Memory String.Kindergarten-Grade 3-Within hearing of her new stepmother, Laura meanly recounts to her disinterested cat what each button on her memory string means. There's one from her great-grandmother's first grown-up dress, another from her mother's wedding dress, and one from the nightgown the woman was wearing when she died three years ago. When the impatient feline jumps away, breaking the string, the buttons fly everywhere. Laura's father and Jane help find all but one of them, but the girl is inconsolable. In the night, she hears them debating about whether to cut an identical button from her father's military uniform. Jane insists, "Laura would rather have that button missing than have a replacement-It's like a mother. No substitute allowed." She finds the lost item with a flashlight and she puts it on the porch where Laura can see it without being offended by the finder. However, in the morning the child has had a change of heart and asks Jane's help in restringing the beads. Rand's oversized, light-dappled watercolor pictures show the love and loyalty between the father and his new wife and their love for the prickly and still-grieving Laura. Bunting trusts readers to interpret behavior and understand complex emotions without her having to provide a moral or dramatic ending. Instead, the story offers a hopeful beginning and invites readers to think about ways to remember family history-including making one's own button memory string.<br><i>Susan Hepler, Burgundy Farm Country Day School, Alexandria, VA </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Inklings and King Arthur: J.

But it has as well an impressive array of essays on all the preeminent Inklings--Tolkien and Lewis and Williams and Barfield--that will be a significant contribution to the study of their Arthurian works in particular and of twentieth-century Arthurian literature in general. ---Verlyn Flieger, Author of <em>Splintered Light, A Question of Time, </em>and<em> Interrupted Music</em></p><p>In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the Arthurian legends and their world were of vital importance to the writing and thought of the major Inklings. Under S�rina Higgins' enterprising editorship, this adventurous and illuminating volumes offers a wealth of insights--from theoretical, contextual, interpretative, and other viewpoints--which will move the study of Barfield, Lewis, Tolkien, Williams, and their immediate predecessors into new and exciting territory, showing that the Inklings' concern with the 'Matter of Britain' was motivated not by nostalgia but by urgent concern for the present and future. --Grevel Lindop, author of <em>Charles Williams: The Third Inkling</em></p><p><em>The Inklings and King Arthur: Owen Barfield, C.

S�rina Higgins has drawn together an impressive group of scholars who offer scholarly yet thoroughly readable essays covering the scope, depth, and influence of Arthuriana in writings of Barfield, Lewis, Tolkien, and Williams. This book should be on the shelf of all Inklings readers.<br> --Don W. King, Montreat College, author of <em>C. S.

It distinctively focusses upon the group rather than only on Lewis, Tolkien, or other members individually, as has often been the case. The circle is represented convincingly in featuring four of the shaping members, all important writers, and their common interest in King Arthur and the Matter of Britain as a living and breathing tradition. This theme is demonstrated to be an important key for unlocking the heartbeat of the informal group, and dispels the persistent myth that the Inklings were not part of, nor relevant to, the concerns of modernist writers after World War I. This deeply researched, sharply up-to-date, and well-unified collection of essays provides a wealth of discoveries for the reader and opens many doors for further Inklings' study. --;Colin Duriez, author of <em>The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and Their Circle, J.R.R.

Reagan seemed ordinary in so many ways, still, millions of people believed in him and followed him. Moreover, he is the patron saint of the modern conservative movement--something that he did not create, yet nonetheless came to embody. <i>Ronald Reagan: How an Ordinary Man Became an Extraordinary Leader</i> is for readers already well-disposed toward the former California governor. It may not change minds, but it will deepen the appreciation felt by Reagan's many admirers, who seem to miss the leader more with each passing day.<b>Dinesh D'Souza,</b> a research scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, served as Senior Domestic Policy Analyst in the Reagan White House from 1987 to 1988.

No problem!</b><p> <b>"Woodshop 101 for Kids"</b> is written as a woodworking curriculum for your kids, it's not just another book that has woodworking projects for kids. Each lesson is laid out step by step so it's easy to understand. Here's what you get:</p><p> * Fun projects that kids will want to build.<br> * Projects are designed to build confidence.<br> * Every project has a "Things You Need" box so you'll know to have on hand.<br> * A cutlist is provided that tells exactly what size to cut each piece of wood.<br> * All the head scratching has been done for you.<br> * All you and your kids have to do is follow along, it's that simple!</p><p> <b>In "Woodshop 101 for Kids" Your Kids Will Learn...</b></p><p> * 21 woodworking lessons that teach the basics of woodworking.<br> * A simple way to read a tape measure.<br> * How to swing a hammer correctly so nails aren't bent and fingers don't get smashed!<br> * How to saw a straight line <b>(most adults can't do this)!</b><br> * How to set up and use a block plane correctly.<br> * How to finish your projects so they'll last a lifetime.<br> * Why math is so important when doing woodworking (like fractions, geometry, etc.).<br> * Science - Basic laws of physics - Force, friction, and Inertia.<br> * And last but not least, your kids will learn valuable life skills they will keep with them for the rest of their lives!</p><p> <b>YOUR CHILD'S SAFETY IS OUR BIGGEST CONCERN!</b></p><p> You only need simple hand tools to build every project in the book. This is much safer than using power tools and allows younger kids to get involved. Using only hand tools has another HUGH advantage: You won't have to go out and spend a bunch of money on tools. You already own most of the tools you'll need!</p><p> <b>Here's a list of the projects you can build:</b></p><p> * <b>Peg Game</b> (easy to build and play, tough to beat!)<br> * <b>Crosscut Box</b> (a jig to help cut boards straight)<br> * <b>Birdhouse</b> (a must for any woodworker!)<br> * <b>Toolbox / Art Caddy</b>(customize your to hold tools or art supplies)<br> * <b>Baseball Rack</b> (holds a baseball, bat, and glove)<br> *<b> Pencil holder</b> (rotates to easily find the right one)<br> * <b>Battleship</b> (built from scrap pieces of wood)<br> * <b>Media Storage Rack</b> (small in size but holds 75 DVDs)<br> * <b>Step Stool</b> (sturdy, and just the right height)<br> * <b>Two for One Bird-feeder</b> (holds seeds and suet)<br> * <b>Workbench</b> (with information on customizing to your child)<br> *<b> Doll Cradle</b> (for that special doll)<br> * <b>Marshmallow Catapult</b> (our most popular project!)<br> * <b>Planter Box</b> (made to last for years outdoors)</p><p> Children are visual and that's why we didn't skimp on the pictures. There are 188 pages with over 280 pictures throughout the book. There are also many graphs, illustrations and definition blocks that will help avoid any confusion about what the lesson is teaching.</p><p> <b>Why Woodworking for Kids is so IMPORTANT!</b></p><p> * It <b>builds</b> self-esteem<br> * It <b>builds</b> self-confidence<br> * It<b> builds</b> a sense of accomplishment<br> * It <b>builds</b> creativity<br> * It <b>builds</b> stronger relationships between you and your children!</p><p> <b>QUESTIONS:</b></p><p> - What's the age range for <b>"Woodshop 101 for Kids"?</b></p><p> * A general guideline is 7-13 yrs/old, but there's much more than age to consider. Reading ability, motor skills, and attention span are really what's important when trying to decide if your child is old enough. I've had 5 year old kids do very well with the material in this book (with much more supervision of course).</p></p><p>Craig Stevens is a husband and father of three children (all of whom love to craft things with their hands). He has been a woodworker for over 15 years and has always been interested in how things work and in making things with his hands. Craig has the desire to pass this knowledge down to the next generation that is growing up not knowing how to use simple tools to make or fix things. He has been involved in teaching woodworking for kids for over 10 years through workshops and videos. He believes that God made each of us with the desire to create, we just need a little help learning how."I really liked the book. &nbsp;As a person with some woodworking experience, I found the book easy to follow and well organized. &nbsp;The skills are presented in a format that is easily followed regardless of past woodworking experience or prior subject matter knowledge."<br>Rick Beardsley, The Old Schoolhouse Magazine, LLC.<br><br>"Right from the start I was impressed with how user-friendly <b><i>Woodshop 101</i></b> is for experienced and novice woodworkers. What impressed me the most is the volume of pictures and illustrations.&nbsp; I also love the fact that, unlike most books that teach woodworking, <b><i>Woodshop 101 for Kids</i></b> is based solely on using hand tools!" ---Cindy Prechtel<br><br>"I really enjoy (<b>Woodshop 101 for Kids</b>). I would have struggled to teach my son woodworking because of my lack of experience. But with the help of your book we're having a great time learning together.

Now, with <i>Body, Mind, and Sport,</i> anyone can reach the Zone, regardless of fitness level. <br><br> Designed to accommodate a variety of individual fitness needs, the <i>Body, Mind, and Sport </i>program is split into two levels. Level 1 is for non-athletes who want to improve overall fitness; Level 2 is for those who want to train for competitive or recreational purposes. Your own unique mind-body type is taken into account to guide you in achieving your personal best without stress or strain. In this revised and updated edition of <i>Body, Mind, and Sport</i>, fitness expert and trainer John Douillard outlines a program in which your individual seasonal constitution-Winter, Spring, or Summer-determines what exercises or sports are best suited to your mind-body type and what foods you should eat for optimum results.<br><br> Using the <i>Body, Mind, and Sport</i> approach you can decrease heart and breath rates while improving both fitness and performance. Dozens of world-class athletes, including Martina Navratilova and Billie Jean King, have used John Douillard's expert breathing techniques, dietary recommendations, and seasonally balanced workouts. Now you can, too!</p><p>John Douillard, author of <b>The 3-Season Diet </b>(Three Rivers Press), is a former professional athlete. He currently works as a consultant to the New Jersey Nets and cohosts a top-rated radio talk show in Colorado called "Health Time." He lives in Boulder, Colorado, with his wife and five children, where he practices Ayurvedic and chiropractic sports medicine.1<br><br><b>Living in the Zone</b><br><br>Pele, the great soccer player whose spectacular performance almost single-handedly inspired American awareness and appreciation of his sport, wrote of his experience of the Zone in his autobiography, My Life and Beautiful Game. "In the middle of a match, I felt a strange calmness I hadn't experienced before. It was a type of euphoria. I felt I could run all day without tiring, that I could dribble through any or all of their team, that I could almost pass through them physically. It was a strange feeling and one that I had not had before. Perhaps it was merely confidence, but I have felt confident many times without that strange feeling of invincibility."<br><br>Baseball players are famous for their exotic pregame rituals in hopes of entering the Zone, in hopes of seeing baseballs as big as watermelons floating to the plate. Superstitions such as wearing dirty socks or garter belts for weeks on end are not unusual. Former Boston Red Sox third baseman Wade Boggs was famous for his pregame chicken dinners. Almost all professional athletes, in their own ways, search for the effortless performance of the Zone.<br><br>It has been called many things. Researchers speak of it as "peak experience" or the "flow state"; they say it is an "altered state" of human consciousness that cannot be intentionally created. Athletes find it difficult to describe when they return from it, although they may attribute it to supernatural concentration, religious mysticism, Zen, visualization, or biorhythms. More commonly, athletes refer to the Zone as the "exercise high," the "runner's high," the "groove," being "unconscious," or being "locked in."<br><br>Byron Scott, of the Los Angeles Lakers, said that when he finds himself in the Zone, "All you can hear is this little voice inside you, telling you 'Shoot' every time you touch the ball, because you know it's going in. Nobody outside can penetrate this world and the person guarding you wishes he wasn't. . . . I could shoot blindfolded from half court over my head and it would go in."<br><br>Joseph Campbell, considered the world's foremost authority on mythology, was interviewed for a PBS series shortly before his death in 1987, when he was in his eighties. During the interview, Bill Moyers asked him, "How do you explain what the psychologist Maslow called 'peak experiences'?" After a pause, Campbell replied, "My own peak experiences, the ones I knew were peak experiences after I had them, all came in athletics."<br><br>The field of sports psychology, which was developed in part to help athletes reproduce the highly coveted experience of the Zone, has failed in its attempts. Dr. Keith Henschen of the University of Utah, who specializes in the field, recognizes the elusive nature and apparently unreproducible experience of the Zone, but at the same time he believes it can be randomly accessed by anyone. That is, it can come to anyone, but it comes when it comes, not necessarily when you want it to. Perhaps the most certain limiting factor, according to Henschen, is that "the harder you try to get there, the less likely it is that you will."<br><br>This generates an interesting paradox. Modern exercise theory revolves around one central pivot, the stress-and-recover cycle, which boils down to this: We must repeatedly push ourselves to our limits and then let the body recover; that is how we become stronger, faster, and so on. The Zone is defined antithetically: The harder you try to reach that state, the less likely it is that you will. Conventional training demands that we put out tremendous effort; the Zone is an experience of absolute effortlessness.<br><br>Before 1954, the 4-minute mile was considered beyond human capability. Then Roger Bannister, an English medical student, cracked the barrier, running a mile in 3:59:4. Bannister said, "We seemed to be going so slowly. . . . I was relaxing so much that my mind seemed almost detached from my body. There was no strain. There was no pain. Only a great unity of movement and aim. The world seemed to stand still or even not exist."<br><br>Bannister's experience was not "No pain, no gain," but rather, "No strain, no pain = historic world record." Although Bannister told the world his formula for success, during the nearly fifty years since his achievement, athletes have continued to train using the stress-and-recover method.<br><br>If we want to reproduce the Zone, doesn't it make more sense that we should reproduce its qualities? If the experience is effortless, then we should cultivate effortlessness, rather than push the body to its limits. It seems na�ve and foolish to expect the light, comfortable, euphoric feeling of the Zone to come with any regularity after the mind has driven the body into exhaustion.<br><br>This is one of the strategies you will learn in this book: capture the ease of the Zone from the first step of each workout, and gracefully build on that experience without dis-integrating the mind from the body.<br><br><b>Do Less and Accomplish More</b><br><br>Warren Wechsler had never considered himself an athlete. He had spent most of his adult life developing his mind, while paying little attention to his body. A successful businessman at 33, Warren suddenly found himself with a burning desire to run and set himself the goal of running a marathon by age 40.<br><br>He had a long way to go. He was overweight, stressed from his job, and completely out of shape. But he bought a pair of top-quality running shoes and started jogging. Very quickly he realized that he felt happier and healthier than before and that he had a natural talent for the sport.<br><br>After four months of pounding the pavement, Warren developed Achilles tendonitis. To alleviate it, he stretched more, went for physical therapy, and took more rest days, but the tightness on long runs persisted. He decided to "run through it"--a common technique among die-hard runners--hoping that the pain would disappear. After four more months Warren's ankle pain worsened. It soon developed into calf pain as well, then worked its way up to the knee. Undaunted, Warren continued his workouts, convinced that "all good things have their price." The aches and pains soon appeared in the other knee. When they reached his back, he was forced to hang up his running shoes.<br><br>Three years later, in 1989, Warren attended my Body, Mind, and Sport seminar. He wanted to get back to running, but, afraid of reinjury, he didn't let himself get his hopes up too high. On hearing the principle that "less is more," and that running, if done properly, should remove strain rather than produce it, Warren decided to give it another go. He began exercising again, cautiously this time, following the specific advice for his body type and listening carefully to the needs of his body. (Body types are fully explained in chapter 4.)<br><br>Warren was so conditioned to expect strain and pain that he found it strange not to hurt during his workouts. At first he noticed that his heart rate would jump from 75 BPM (beats per minute) to 170 or 180 as soon as he started exercising with even moderate exertion. After three months of reconditioning his body to do less and accomplish more on his exercise bike, he found that he could pedal for over an hour with his heart rate around 120 and his breath rate even and comfortable at around 15 breaths per minute.<br><br>In January 1990, Warren felt ready to run and rejoined his health club, which featured an indoor track. At first, finding himself lapped by his old running partners, he had to struggle against his desire to keep up with them. Listening carefully to his body--not to the ambitions of his mind or to his sense of pride--he let them pass him. Gradually he picked up speed. Soon he surpassed his former running partners, only this time he did so without injury or pain.<br><br>He called me at my office eighteen months after starting the Invincible Athletics program and gave me this report:<br><br>John, I'm 38 years old. I've never been an athlete in my life. I took your course to give my running one last try. Since then, I've lost 30 pounds and 6 inches of girth without trying or dieting. I don't get sick or anxious anymore, and I've got more vitality than I've ever known.<br><br>Yesterday, running on my indoor track, I ran 17 miles. I felt absolutely fantastic the whole way. I felt as good when I stopped as I did when I started. The amazing thing was that I ran a 6-minute-mile pace for the entire 17 miles. It was unbelievable. I was in the Zone. I felt like I was running on air. It was the easiest thing I've ever done.<br><br>The most incredible thing was that my heart rate averaged about 120 BPM during the entire run. Sometimes it went even lower, but it never went over 130 BPM while I maintained the 6-minute pace. When I counted my breath rate, it was between 12 and 15 breaths per minute. [The average breath rate at rest is 18 breaths per minute.] At this rate, when I'm 40 I could be running marathons with the best runners in the world, having the runner's high experience the entire time.<br><br>For Warren, exercise had become a means of removing stress. The more he ran, the more rejuvenated he felt.<br><br>We had been working with many athletes at our health center and finding some dramatic decreases in exertion during high-level exercise using our techniques, but a heart rate of 120 BPM while maintaining a 6-minute-mile pace was hard to believe. I figured that perhaps Warren's monitoring equipment wasn't first-rate and invited him to our health center to verify his findings.<br><br>When he came, I put him on the treadmill. It wasn't long before he had the equipment "maxed out" at 10.5 miles per hours (a little better than a 6-minute mile), and, sure enough, his heart rate was stable at about 125 BPM and he was breathing easily at just the rate he had reported. The average runner would have to strain pretty hard to run a 6-minute mile, showing heart rates up to 180 BPM and breath rates up to 40 or 50 breaths per minute.<br><br>Warren's success came because he was determined not to incur stress but to let his body gracefully improve from the inside out. He never put pressure on himself to reach any specific time, either to meet an arbitrary deadline or to compete in a given race. He simply wanted to see how fast he could run and with how little effort.<br><br>Lowering heart and breath rates while running faster and faster is like driving a big old Cadillac and getting 50 miles per gallon. This possibility provides a new level of motivation: to see not only what one can do, but with how little effort and with how much efficiency it can be done. (I discuss how to do this in chapters 13 and 14, which describe the Three-Phase Workout.)<br><br>Not long after Warren's visit to me at the health center, he ran his first marathon. He cruised at a comfortable 61?2-minute-mile pace the whole way, finishing with ease and comfort at 2 hours 53 minutes. The next day he went out and ran 5 miles. Even more amazing, four days later he did a 10-mile run in a time that was his personal best.<br><br>Warren's strategy was to treat every race as a training race. He felt that if he could stay within himself, taking his cues from himself and not from any preconceived or outward standard, he would continue to rejuvenate himself with each run and steadily get better. More important, he would enjoy every race.<br><br>With this attitude, Warren fell in love with exercise. He was becoming fit, but this time it wasn't a case of his body being whipped into shape by his mind. He was feeling a deep sense of integrity and efficiency, as if he could run all day without strain. As he continued to improve, he would monitor his heart and breath rates and watch them remain low while he effortlessly attained competitive speeds and distances. To his amazement and delight, the harmony of his mind and body was reflected in his increasing ability to be in the Zone.<br><br>The principles described in this book are derived from ancient teachings that far predate the sports psychologists' discouraging pronouncements that the Zone is not reproducible. I believe--on the basis of my professional experience--that not only should the runner's high or Zone experience be expected with every workout, but that reaching this experience is the primary purpose of exercise. Only through this experience can we access our highest physical potential.<br><br>To prove this very bold point--that the elusive Zone is readily available within all of us and can be called up intentionally--we must look into the origins of exercise and sport.<br><br><b>Training Tip No. 1<br>The Acid Test</b><br><br>Try your normal workout while breathing through your nose. If you find it more difficult than usual and can't get enough oxygen, this indicates that you do not have maximum respiratory efficiency, and that you need this program! You can reach your full respiratory potential when you learn how to draw on it.<br><br><b>Back to the Future</b><br><br>If we went far enough back in time, we would see that the purpose of exercise was not to build muscles, lose weight, win races, or receive gold medals. To the ancient Greeks, for example, exercise was a vital part of daily life. The historian Xenophon said, "No citizen has any right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training; it is part of his profession as a citizen to keep himself in good condition." He added that it is "a disgrace for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and the strength of which his body is capable."<br><br>This attitude had a deeper, spiritual basis, explained by the great Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle. Plato, throughout his writings, emphasized the importance of exercise for developing the spiritual side of life. His ideal was harmonious perfection of both the body and the mind, or soul, and exercise was one of the methods he advocated. Aristotle also favored exercise and emphasized a theme that I will return to often in this book: that exercise should be moderate rather than excessive or insufficient, and that it should be undertaken in accordance with one's individual physical capacity.<br><br>Today, historians point out that the original martial arts did not consist solely of kicks, blocks, and punches. Their real purpose was to be found in the spiritual side, an aspect largely missing in modern American dojos. Even members of the U.S. karate team lament the absence of a spiritual base.<br><br>The history of the martial arts is sketchy in places, but most historians now agree that its roots in China were actually seeded from the even older Vedic culture of India. About fourteen hundred years ago an Indian monk named Bodhidharma journeyed from India over the Himalayas to bring the teachings of Buddha to China. He stopped to teach at the Shaolin Monastery in the Honan Province of central China. Tradition regards his teachings at Shaolin as the origin of the martial arts in China.

(S.&amp; S., 2013). While colorful images present each type of boat, text extends the vocabulary well past boat parts (keel, hull, bow, stern, bilge, beam, fore, aft, sail, engine, paddle, oar, poop-deck, head, bridge, galley) to a global adventure of small and large crafts (gondola, skiff, bilibili, sampan, junk, coracle, dinghy). Each page presents a picture "from shore to shore" through digital images and rhyming text. Perspectives change along a river, through the water, under the waves, from the birds above to a cross-view of the galley below, with a soft texture in imitation of the aquatic surroundings. From the smallest toy boat to an ocean liner, this book has all vessel sizes covered, enough to convince readers to stretch out, float, and "be a boat."

Sonny Barger is the Hell&#39;s Angel of all Hell&#39;s Angels, the motorcycle club that has been the scourge of America for over forty years. Sonny was their de facto leader for much of that time, the man who Hunter S. Thompson immortalised in his 1965 classic Hells Angels, noting &#39;Barger is nothing short of Winston Churchill when it comes to leading people&#39;. He&#39;s been called an American legend and he&#39;s feared and revered by people on both sides of the law. From the club&#39;s formation in the 1940s to the height of their notoriety twenty years later, from Sonny&#39;s first-hand account of what really happened with the Rolling Stones at Altamont to his periods of imprisonment, from his fights with rival gangs and the police to his own battle with cancer, &#39;Hell&#39;s Angel&#39; sets the record straight. Sonny Barger has ridden with the Angels for forty years, obeying no law but that of the HAMC. For the first time, this is his own -- and their own -- story.</p><p>Ralph &#34;Sonny&#34; Barger rides his customized Harley Davidson FXRT sportster every day and bench presses 285 pounds. Keith and Kent Zimmerman are twins. They are the co-authors of the bestselling Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs, the autobiography of John Lydon.Chapter OneMuster To Custer<p>A motorcycle run is a get-together, a moving party. It's a real show of power and solidarity when you're a Hell's Angel. It's being free and getting away from all the bullshit. Angels don't go on runs looking for trouble; we go to ride our bikes and to have a good time together. We are a club.</p><p>Most Hell's Angels are great riders. A group of Hell's Angels cruising down the road, riding next to each other and traveling at a speed of over eighty miles an hour, is a real sight. It's something else, a whole other thing, when you're in the pack riding. It's fast and dangerous and by God, you better be paying attention. Whatever happens to the guy in front of you is going to happen to you. It's different from other vehicles. You gotta be alert. Like Fuzzy, an Oakland Angel, once said, "God damn, we do eighty-five or ninety in the rain sometimes. I don't even go that fast in my car!"</p><p>When Hell's Angels chapters started getting chartered outside the state of California in the late sixties, that's when we first started our cross-country rides like the USA and World Runs. We'd meet up with the new clubs along the way, and they'd join the run. Man, we used to ride from Oakland to New York on those early rigidframe bikes, and they bounced around so much that if you drove sixty miles in an hour you were making great time. The vibration left you tingling and numb for about an hour after you got off your bike. lf you covered three or four hundred miles in a day you were hauling ass. The other big problem then was that we'd have to find gas stations every forty miles or so, since those old-style bikes with small tanks couldn't make it past sixty miles. Today, on a Harley FXRT, with their rubber-mounted motors and big gas tanks, you not only get a smoother ride, you can log five or six hundred miles a day on a few tanks of gas without breaking a sweat.</p><p>The big differences between the Hell's Angels and the rest of the motorcycle world are our bikes and the way we ride. This is serious business to us. Our bikes are us. We know that. The copsknow that, and everybody else should know that too. The law and the road are one. Even today, if the cops know a large group of Hell's Angels is headed somewhere, they'll show up in force, alerting neighboring police forces along the way. This mutual assistance pact they set up has been used against us for as long as I can remember. It's no different today than it was thirty years ago. We keep going and they keep coming around with all their surveillance methods and radio equipment watching us and keeping tabs. We don't look for trouble or have intentions of starting any, but by God, it always seems to be around.</p><p>The reactions of law enforcement can depend on where you are. We were on the road tearing through the Texas panhandle and on into Oklahoma. As we approached Oklahoma City, ten or twelve Oklahoma state troopers pulled onto the freeway and escorted us right through the city limits. They didn't even want us stopping for gas.</p><p>In Texas a cop asked me, "Excuse me, partner, but ... why do you and your friends carry those big knives?"</p><p>I told him, "Because we're all felons and we can't carry a big gun like you."</p><p>Another time in Missouri, fifteen of us were sitting by the side of the road taking a break when a state trooper pulled up, got out of his car, walked up to us, and said, "Mind if I ask a stupid question?"</p><p>"Not if you don't mind a stupid answer."</p><p>"What are fifteen Hell's Angels from California doing sitting on the side of the road in Missouri?"</p><p>"We lost four or five of our people and now we can't figure out where they're at."</p><p>The trooper thought for a few seconds. "I just might be able to help you. I could get on my radio and start checking around and help you find them." He radioed around to a bunch of stations and other troopers, and once he located them, he gave us directions on how to meet up with our lost brothers.</p><p>On the other side of the coin, there was a cop in Texas who spotted us on a highway outside of Amarillo, got scared, or else thought he was doing his job, and called for reinforcements. They roadblocked the highway in front of us with machine guns. Another time on our way to South Carolina we were stopped and each of us was ID'd. It took over two hours, and all for nothing. Cops can be assholes when they want to be.</p><p>The Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club has four or five mandatory runs per year and probably fifteen or twenty parties and smaller runs. If you multiply that by the forty years the Oakland club has been around, that's a lot of motorcycling. But of all the runs, there is one in particular that sticks in my mind, and that was the time we decended on the big annual Black Hills motorcycle run in Sturgis, South Dakota, in 1982. I'll try to describe it as best I can remember it, because in my mind it separated the sheep from the goats. We code-named that run "Muster to Custer."</p><p>There was another motorcycle club-whose name I won't mention because it is a big club and we've been at odds with them for years-who in early 1982 had said publicly that the only reason the Hell's Angels didn't go to Sturgis was because <i>they</i> went to Sturgis.</p></p><h2>Flashcards for Differentiating Surgical Instruments: General, Laparoscopic, OB-GYN, Robotic &amp; Basic Ortho</h2><p><ul><br> <li>219 cards illustrating the instruments and staplers most commonly used for general, laparoscopic, robotics, and OB/GYN surgeries.</li><br> <li>20 bonus cards covering even more specialties</li><br> <li>10-12 special cards suggesting activities to make learning fun and easy.</li><br> <li>Large steel gray piece of foldable Tyvek representing a &#x201c;Mayo Stand&#x201d; &#x2014;perfect for practicing Mayo stand set-up activities on the go.</li><br></ul></p><p></p><h2>The Invisible Classroom: Relationships, Neuroscience &amp; Mindfulness in School (The Norton Series on the Social Neuroscience of Education)</h2><p><p><strong>Improving student learning with the tools of neuroscience and mindfulness.</strong></p> How is expanding students&#x2019; strengths more effective than improving their weaknesses?

Aristophanes is still regarded by modern audiences as a master of risqu� wit and brilliant comic invention.1<br>Aeschylus<br><br><b>AGAMEMNON</b><br><br>The trilogy called Oresteia, of which <b>Agamemnon</b> is the first play, deals with the succession of crimes and their retribution in the house of Atreus. The series had started, before the action of <b>Agamemnon</b> begins, when Atreus had unfairly kept his brother Thyestes from the throne of Argos. In <b>Agamemnon</b> Thyestes' son Aegisthus and Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra murder Agamemnon and seize his throne. In <b>Choephoroe</b>, the second play of the trilogy, Orestes avenges his father Agamemnon's murder by murdering Clytemnestra and Aegisthus. In <b>Eumenides</b>, the third play, hereditary blood vengeance is ended when a newly instituted court acquits Orestes. Other crimes antecedent to its action are involved in the problems of <b>Agamemnon</b>: the abduction of Helen, the war of reprisal against Troy, Agamemnon's sacrifice of his daughter Iphigenia to raise the winds for the Greek fleet becalmed at Aulis. It was during Agamemnon's absence at Troy that Aegisthus and Clytemnestra formed their illicit relationship and plotted his murder.<br><br>The tragedy of <b>Agamemnon</b> involves war and politics as well as a domestic triangle, and in none of its aspects is an unqualified right opposed to an unqualified wrong. It was wrong for Trojan Paris to abduct Helen, and right for the crime to be punished; but Helen was an evil woman, and Argives murmured at the slaughter of their young men in a war for an evil woman's sake. The chorus, consistently loyal to Agamemnon, elaborates, on the horror of the sacrifice of Iphigenia, the waywardness of Helen, and the cost of the war in Argive blood. The dissatisfaction of the Argives as well as his hereditary claim provide at least the appearance of justification for Aegisthus' usurpation. Nor is the behavior of Clytemnestra, who is at once described as a woman with the temper of a man, wholly without justification. Agamemnon had earned her hatred, she says, when he wantonly sacrificed her first-born; he had been unfaithful to her in his stay at Troy, and had even brought Cassandra home with him as a concubine; and finally, she was not herself the murderer but only the instrument of fate. In the end she hopes for a peaceful rule for herself and Aegisthus.<br><br>The rich and subtle poetry of <b>Agamemnon</b> is a perfect medium for its problems and insights. Recurrent images and verbal patterns create implicit connections in themes separate in time and place and provide psychological background for the action in hand. The tone of foreboding is set by the nameless watchman speaking on the roof of the palace at dawn, and the old men of the chorus weave a psychological backdrop in their majestic ode on the moral implications of the Trojan War and the sacrifice of Iphigenia, a backdrop elaborated by subsequent lyrics on the curse of Helen and the horrors of war and by Cassandra's prophetic danse macabre when she steps from Agamemnon's chariot. The swiftness and the drama of the action is introduced by the beacon speech. Spectacle itself produced high drama in the carpet scene, which not only supplies full and complete characterization of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra but communicates utter doom when Agamemnon treads the blood-colored carpet across the wide orchestra and into the palace doors which close behind him.<br><br>CHARACTERS<br><br>WATCHMAN<br>CHORUS OF ARGIVE ELDERS<br>CLYTEMNESTRA, wife of Agamemnon<br>HERALD<br>AGAMEMNON, King of Argos<br>CASSANDRA, daughter of Priam and slave of Agamemnon<br>AEGISTHUS, son of Thyestes and cousin of Agamemnon<br>ATTENDANTS<br>SCENE: Palace at Argos<br><br>Translated by A. W. Verrall<br><br>WATCHMAN: (on palace roof): A whole long year of watch have I prayed heaven for release, a year that, like a dog, I have made my bed in the embrace of this palace roof, till I know all the nightly company of the stars, and chiefly those chief signs that, marked by their brightness for the princes of the sky, bring summer and winter to man, all their wanings and their risings. And still I am watching for the token-flame, the beacon-blaze which is to carry the news from Troy, the tidings of the capture! This it is to be commanded by a woman, who brings her quick hopes into the business of men! When I have found my bed, rain-wetted, restless, and safer than some are from the visit of dreams (for instead of sleep comes the fear that sleeping might close my eyes forever), and when the fancy comes to whistle or sing by way of a salve for drowsiness, then tears arise of sorrow for what has befallen this house, now put to no such good work as in the old days. But ah, this time may the blessed release be given, the blessed beacon dawn with its message from the dark.<br>O joy! O welcome blaze, that shows in night as it were a dawn, you harbinger of many a dance, that shall be set in Argos for this good fortune! What ho! What ho! Lady of Agamemnon, I cry you loud: Up from the dark couch, quick, up, and raise the morning-hymn of your house in honor of yonder fire, if, as the signal manifestly announces, Troy town is taken indeed. Aye, and myself at least will prelude the dancing; for my score shall profit by my master's game, the treble-six, thrown me by yonder fire-signal.<br>Well, may the king return, may I clasp his welcome hand in mine. The rest shall be unspoken (my tongue has upon it an ox-foot weight), though the house itself, if it could find a voice, might declare it plain enough; for I mean to be, for my part, clear to who knows and to him who knows not blind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exit.)<br><br>(Enter chorus.)<br><br>CHORUS: Tis now the tenth year since, to urge their powerful right against Priam, King Menelaus and King Agamemnon, the mighty sons of Atreus, paired in the honor of throne and scepter derived from Zeus, put forth from this land with an Argive armament, a thousand crews of fighting men, summoned to their aid.<br>Loud rang their angry battle-cry, as the scream of vultures who, vexed by boys in the supreme solitudes where they nest, wheel with beating pinions round and round, when they miss the young brood whose bed it was their care to watch. And the shrill sad cry of the birds is heard by ears supreme, by Apollo belike or Pan or Zeus, who to avenge the licensed sojourners of their dwelling-place, sends soon or late on the offenders the ministers of punishment. Even such ministers are the sons of Atreus, sent to punish the triumph of Paris by their mightier Zeus, guardian of hospitality, that so for a woman whom many could win there should be wrestlings many and weary, where the knee is pressed in the dust and the shaft, the spousal shaft, is snapped, between suffering Greek and Trojan suffering too.<br>The cause is this day no further: the end will be as it must. By no increase of fuel or libation, and by no tears, shalt thou overcome the stubbornness of a sacrifice that will not burn.<br>As for us, whose worn thews could not render their service, that martial gathering left us behind, and here we bide, on guiding-staves supporting our childish strength. For if the young breast, where the sap is rising, is no better than eld but in this, that the spirit of war is not there, oh what is man, when he is more than old? His leaf is withered, and with his three feet he wanders, weak as a child, a day-lit dream.<br>But what of thee, daughter of Tyndareus, Queen Clytemnestra? What chance? What news? On what intelligence, what convincing report are thy messengers gone round bidding sacrifice? To all the gods that dwell in Argos, upper and nether gods, the high gods and the low, the altars blaze with gifts, while on all sides the flames soar up to the sky, yielding to the innocent spell and soft persuasion of hallowed oil, rich from the store of kings. All this (so far as thou canst and mayest consent) do thou explain, and thus cure my present care, which vexes me now anon, although at whiles the sacrifices call up a kindly hope and drive from my mind the unsated thought that still returns to the prey.<br>It is my right to tell--it is an encouragement upon their way permitted to them whose vigor is past, that still at their years they draw from heaven that winning inspiration, which is the strength of song--how the twin-throned Achaean Kings, concordant leaders of Hellas' youth, were sped with avenging arm and spear to the Teucrian land by a gallant omen, when to the kings of ships appeared the black king of birds and the white-backed king together, seen near the palace on the spear-hand in conspicuous place, feasting on hares, then full of young, stayed one course short of home.<br>Be sorrow, sorrow spoken, but still let the good prevail!<br>Then the good seer, who followed the host, when he saw how the two brave Atridae were in temper twain, took cognizance of those hare-devouring birds and of the princely captains, and thus he spake interpreting: After long time they that here go forth must win King Priam's town, though ere they pass the wall all their cattle, their public store, shall perforce be divided and consumed. Only may no divine displeasure foresmite and overcloud the gathering of the host, whose might should bridle Troy. For the wrath of holy Artemis rests on the house of those winged coursers of her sire, who sacrifice a trembling mother with all her young unborn. She loathes such a feast of eagles.<br>Be sorrow, sorrow spoken, but still let the good prevail!<br>Yea, fair one, loving though thou art unto the uncouth whelps of many a fierce breed, and sweet to the suckling young of all that roam the field, yet to this sign thou art prayed to let the event accord. Auspicious are these eagle-omens, but not without a flaw. But oh, in the blessed name of the Healer, raise thou not hindering winds, long to delay from the seas the Argive fleet; urge not a second sacrifice, foul offering of forbidden meat, which shall put hate between flesh and bone and break marital awe. For patient, terrible, never to be laid, is the wrath of the wife still plotting at home revenge for the unforgotten child.<br><br>Thus Calchas crossed his chant of high promise to the royal house from the omens of the march: and so with according burden<br>Be sorrow, sorrow spoken, but still let the good prevail!<br>Zeus--power unknown, whom, since so to be called is his own pleasure, I by that name address. When I ponder upon all things, I can conjecture nought but Zeus to fit the need, if the burden of vanity is in very truth to be cast from the soul. Not he, who perhaps was strong of yore and flushed with victorious pride, could now be so much as proved to have had being: and he that came next hath found his conqueror and is gone. But whoso to Zeus by forethought giveth titles of victory, the guess of his thought shall be right. And Zeus it is who leadeth men to understanding under this law, that they learn a truth by the smart thereof. The wound, where it lies dormant, will bleed, and its aching keep before the mind the memory of the hurt, so that wisdom comes to them without their will. And it is perhaps a mercy from a Power, who came by struggle to his majestic seat.<br><br>Thus it was with the Achaean admiral, the elder of the twain. A prophet, thought he, is not to blame, so he bent before the blast. But when his folk began to weary of hindering wind and empty cask, still lying over against Chalcis, where the tides of Aulis rush to and fro, while still the gales blew thwart from Strymon, stayed them and starved them, and penned them in port, grinding the men and making of ship and tackle a prodigal waste, and with lapse of time, doubled over and over, still withering the flower of Argos away; then at last, when the prophet's voice pointed to Artemis and told of yet one more means to cure the tempest's bane, a means pressing more on the princes, which made the sons of Atreus beat their staves upon the ground and let the tear roll down--the elder then of the twain found voice and said:<br><br>"Sore is my fate if I obey not, and sore if I must slay my child, the jewel of my home, staining paternal hands with virgin stream from the victim at the altar's side. Are not the two ways woeful both? How can I fail my fleet and lose my soldiery? For eager is their craving that to stay the winds her virgin blood should be offered up, and well they may desire it. May it be for the best!"<br>So, having put on his neck the harness of Necessity, his spirit set to the new quarter, impious, wicked, unholy, and from that moment he took to his heart unflinching resolve. For to put faith in the shedding of blood is an obstinate delusion, whose base suggestion is the beginning of sin. Howsoever he did not shrink from slaying a victim daughter in aid of war waged for a stolen wife, a spousalrite to bind unto him his fleet!<br><br>Her prayers, her cries to her father, mere life-breath of a girl, the spectators, eager for war, regarded not at all. Her father, after prayer, gave word to the ministers, while casting her robes about her she bowed herself desperately down, to lift her, as it were a kid, over the altar, and, for prevention of her beautiful lips, to stop the voice that might curse his house with the dumb cruel violence of the gag.<br><br>And she, as she let fall to earth her saffron robe, smote each one of the sacrificers with glance of eye that sought their pity, and seemed like as in a painting, fain to speak: for oft had she sung where men were met at her father's noble board, with pure voice virginally doing dear honor to the grace and blessing that crowned her father's feast.<br><br>What followed I saw not, neither do I tell. The rede of Calchas doth not lack fulfillment. Yet it is the law that only to experience knowledge should fall: when the future comes, then thou mayest hear of it; ere that, I care not for the hearing, which is but anticipating sorrows; it will come clear enough, and with it the proof of the rede itself. Enough: let us pray for such immediate good, as the present matter needs. Here is our nearest concern, this fortress, sole protection of the Argive land.<br><br>(Enter Clytemnestra.)<br><br>I am come, Clytemnestra, in observance of your command. It is right to render obedience to the sovereign and queen, when the husband's throne is empty. Now whether tidings good or not good have moved you by this ceremony to announce good hope, I would gladly learn from you: though if you would keep the secret, I am content.<br><br>CLYTEMNESTRA: For "good," as says the proverb, may the kind morn announce it from her kind mother night. But "hope" is something short of the joy you will hear. The Argive army has taken Priam's town.<br><br>CHORUS: How say you? I scarce caught the words, so incredible they were.<br><br>CLYTEMNESTRA: I said that Troy is ours. Do I speak clear?<br><br>CHORUS: It is joy that surprises me and commands its tear.<br><br>CLYTEMNESTRA: Yes, it is a loyal gladness of which your eye accuses you.<br><br>CHORUS: And what then is the proof? Have you evidence of this?<br><br>CLYTEMNESTRA: I have indeed, if miracle deceive me not.<br><br>CHORUS: Is it a dream-sign that commands your easy credence?<br><br>CLYTEMNESTRA: Not sight-proof would I accept from a brain bemused.<br><br>CHORUS: Yet can you have taken cheer from some uncertified presage?<br><br>CLYTEMNESTRA: You hold my sense as low as it were a babe's.<br><br>CHORUS: And what sort of time is it since the city fell?<br><br>CLYTEMNESTRA: It fell, I say, in the night whence yonder light is this moment born.<br><br>CHORUS: But what messenger could arrive so quick?</p><h2>The Other Side of Chaos: Breaking Through When Life Is Breaking Down</h2><p><p></p>First Place, Inspirational category<br>ACP Excellence in Publishing Awards, 2012<br>From satisfying work to sudden unemployment.

Cherlin's three decades of study have shown him that marriage in America is a social and political battlefield in a way that it isn&#x2019;t in other developed countries. Americans marry and divorce more often and have more live-in partners than Europeans, and gay Americans have more interest in legalizing same-sex marriage. The difference comes from Americans&#x2019; embrace of two contradictory cultural ideals: marriage, a formal commitment to share one's life with another; and individualism, which emphasizes personal choice and self-development. Religion and law in America reinforce both of these behavioral poles, fueling turmoil in our family life and heated debate in our public life. Cherlin&#x2019;s incisive diagnosis is an important contribution to the debate and points the way to slowing down the partnership merry-go-round.</p><p>Andrew J. Cherlin is the Benjamin H. Griswold III Professor of Sociology and Public Policy at Johns Hopkins University and is the author of <i>Public and Private Families</i>. His articles have appeared in <i>The New York Times Magazine, The Nation,</i> and on the op-ed pages of <i>The New York Times, The Washington Post,</i> and other publications.

He lives in Baltimore.chapter 1<br><br>65<br><br>How American Family Life Is Different<br><br>On Valentine&#x2019;s Day in 2005, Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who would gain recognition in 2008 as a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and his wife, Janet, converted their marriage to a covenant marriage in front of a crowd of 6,400 at an arena in North Little Rock. The governor was aware that few Arkansas couples were choosing the covenant option&#x2014;of the first hundred thousand or so marriages that had begun since it was introduced in 2001, about six hundred couples had chosen it. In Louisiana and Arizona, the other states that offered covenant marriages, the take- up rate wasn&#x2019;t much better. Advocates for covenant marriage claimed that many couples were unaware of it and that the laws had been poorly implemented. Even so, the numbers were far smaller than anyone expected. Those who chose Arkansas&#x2019;s option agreed to undergo premarital counseling. They also agreed that if either spouse ever requested a divorce, they would attend marital counseling before splitting up. And they agreed that neither spouse could obtain a quick divorce based on &#x201c;no-fault&#x201d; grounds such as incompatibility. Only if the other spouse had committed a serious transgression such as adultery or physical or sexual abuse could a covenant-married person ask for an immediate divorce. Otherwise, the person who wanted out had to wait at least two years for a divorce.<br><br>In order to breathe life into this moribund option, the governor had announced his intention to enter into a covenant marriage and invited others to join him. &#x201c;This law allows couples to choose to be held to a higher level of marital commitment,&#x201d; he said in a radio address promoting his rally. At the event, thousands of married couples, many bused by their churches, filed into the arena as love songs played on the public address system. After the governor and his wife exchanged vows, they asked the couples in the audience to stand and face each other, and they led a mass recitation of vows. Only the Huckabees&#x2019; ceremony legally counted as a covenant marriage, however, because couples who are already married must submit an affidavit to the county clerk in order to convert their marriages, and according to news reports the logistics had proven too complicated for the churches that were supporting the rally. Nevertheless, the governor, a former Baptist pastor, had made his point: there was too much divorce in Arkansas and people&#x2019;s commitment to their marriages needed to be strengthened.<br><br>Governor Huckabee&#x2019;s concern about the divorce rate in Arkansas, which led him to sponsor the Valentine&#x2019;s Day covenant marriage rally, was well-taken. In 2004, for instance, Arkansas had the second-highest number of divorces per person of any state (after Nevada, a divorce destination that does a brisk business with out-of-state visitors). But Governor Huckabee may not have known that Arkansas also had a large number of weddings. In 2004, it had the third-highest per capita rate of marriage (after Nevada and Hawaii, two popular wedding destinations). With much divorce and much marriage, Arkansas exemplifies the American pattern.<br><br>That a state in the Bible Belt&#x2014;Arkansas is well above average in church membership&#x2014;has a high rate of marriage may seem unremarkable; by contrast, its high divorce rate may seem odd. Yet six of the ten states with the highest divorce rates are in the South, and the other four are in the West. George W. Bush carried all ten states in the 2004 presidential election, which suggests that having a socially conservative electorate does not insulate a state from divorce. It is true that people who are religious are less likely to divorce, but religious Americans still have high divorce rates by international standards. Moreover, people in high-divorce states tend to have less education, to marry earlier, and not to be Catholic&#x2014;all of which are risk factors for divorce. That&#x2019;s why Arkansas stands out: it has one of the lowest percentages of high school graduates and of Catholics, and one of the lowest median ages at marriage, of any state.<br><br>Both marriage and divorce contribute to the larger picture of a country in which people partner, unpartner, and repartner faster than do people in any other Western nation. They form cohabiting relationships easily, but they end them after a shorter time than people in other nations. They tend to marry at younger ages. After a divorce, they tend to find a new partner more quickly. In other words, having several partnerships is more common in the United States not just because people exit intimate partnerships faster but also because they enter them faster and after a breakup reenter them faster. We know these facts from the work of demographers using the Fertility and Family Surveys, a remarkable set of surveys conducted between 1989 and 1997 in European countries, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States (as well as from other surveys in Great Britain and Australia, two countries that were not included). In each nation researchers asked a large, random sample of individuals comparable questions about their marriages, divorces, and cohabiting relationships.<br><br>Why, you might ask, did researchers go to the expense and trouble of carrying out these surveys throughout Western Europe and overseas English-speaking countries? The answer is that enormous changes have occurred in family life not only in the United States but also throughout the Western world in the past half century (and in much of the rest of the world, too, for that matter). People everywhere are concerned about the future of the family as they know it. In the Scandinavian countries and in France, cohabitation is even more common than in the United States, and a large proportion of all births occur to cohabiting couples&#x2014;more than half of first births in Sweden. Divorce rates have increased, too, although not to the height seen in the United States. But what drives European concern is not the decline of marriage but rather the decline in births. It&#x2019;s hard for Americans to understand this concern because we don&#x2019;t share it. American women have enough children to maintain the size of our population, even ignoring immigration. In many European countries, in contrast, women are having fewer births. Countries such as France and Germany have long been concerned with keeping their populations up so that they can field armies large enough to defend themselves. More recently, they have been concerned about having enough working-age adults to care for their growing elderly populations.<br><br>In the United States, however, the concern is about marriage, and the Fertility and Family Surveys have much to say about it. To compare, say, current divorce rates across countries, ideally we would interview a sample of people who get married this year in each country, follow them for the next several decades, and see how many become divorced. But no mere mortal has the time to wait that long. Instead, demographers use the &#x201c;life table&#x201d; method, so called because one of its first uses was to estimate how long people would live so that insurance companies could determine how much to charge them for life insurance policies. It can be used to estimate the expected &#x201c;survival&#x201d; time of marriages, cohabiting relationships, or periods of singlehood. Its estimates will be inaccurate if conditions change greatly in the future. Essentially, the life table answers this question: if conditions stay the same as they have been recently, how long would we expect a marriage, a cohabiting relationship, or a spell of being single to last?<br><br>The American Difference<br><br>Here are some comparisons that can be made between women in the United States (the American survey did not include men) and in other Western nations in the mid-1990s, when most of the surveys were conducted:<br><br>� Americans marry and cohabit for the first time sooner than people in most other Western nations. Half of all first marriages occurred by age twenty-five in the United States, compared to age twenty-nine in Italy, thirty in France, thirty-one in Sweden, and thirty-two in the former West Germany. In part, ages of marriage are older in Europe because in some countries more young adults cohabit prior to marrying. Yet even if we consider the age at which half of all first partnerships of either kind (marital or cohabiting) occur, American women were relatively young: age twenty-two, compared to twenty-one in Sweden, age twenty-three in France, twenty-six in West Germany, and twenty-eight in Italy.<br><br>� A higher proportion of Americans marry at some point in their lives than in most other Western nations: 84 percent of American women are predicted to marry by age forty. In contrast, the forecast drops to 70 percent in Sweden and 68 percent in France. (For technical reasons, all of these forecasts are likely to be somewhat lower than the actual percentages who will ever marry.) If we consider both marital and cohabiting relationships, however, over 90 percent of women in nearly all countries will eventually begin an intimate partnership.<br><br>So Americans begin to have partners at a relatively young age, whereas many Europeans wait longer. And Americans turn those partnerships into marriages&#x2014;or marry without living together beforehand&#x2014;much more quickly. In France and the Nordic countries, in contrast, young adults tend to live with partners for several years before marrying, if they marry at all. In some southern European countries, such as Spain and Italy, living together prior to marrying is less common, and many young adults live with their parents well into their twenties before marrying. Other English-speaking countries are more similar to the United States, but people there still marry at somewhat older ages and are less likely to ever marry over their lifetimes.<br><br>� Marriages and cohabiting relationships in the United States are far more fragile than elsewhere. After only five years, more than one-fifth of Americans who marry had separated or divorced, compared to half that many or even fewer in other Western nations. And among Americans who began a cohabiting relationship, over half had broken up five years later (as opposed to remaining together, whether they subsequently married or not), which is a substantially higher figure than in other nations. Whether they started a partnership by marrying or by living together, Americans were less likely to be living with that partner five years later.<br><br>� Because of these fragile partnerships, American children born to married or cohabiting parents are more likely to see their parents&#x2019; partnership break up than are children in most other countries. Forty percent experienced a breakup by age fifteen. About the same percentage experienced a breakup in New Zealand. In Sweden, the country with the next-highest rate, the comparable figure was 30 percent; it was in the high twenties in western Germany and Canada, and the low twenties in France and Australia. Children born to cohabiting parents in the United States and New Zealand faced exceptionally high risks of experiencing a breakup: about three- fourths no longer lived with both parents at age fifteen. But even if we look just at children born to married couples, American children were more likely to see their parents break up. In fact, children born to married parents in the United States were more likely to experience their parents&#x2019; breakup than were children born to cohabiting parents in Sweden.<br><br>Without doubt, then, there are more breakups of married and cohabiting couples in the United States than in any other Western country with the possible exception of New Zealand. So not only do Americans marry more, they also divorce more. Moreover, they end their cohabiting relationships more quickly. So they start and end partnerships with a speed that is virtually unmatched.<br><br>� After their breakups, American parents are more likely to repartner. Consequently, children in the United States who have seen their parents&#x2019; partnership end are more likely to have another adult partner (cohabiting or married) enter their household than are children living elsewhere. In the United States, nearly half of children who had experienced the breakup of their parents&#x2019; marriage or cohabiting relationship saw the entry of another partner into their household within three years, a much higher proportion than in Sweden (where one-third see a new partner within three years), West Germany<br><br>(29 percent), France (23 percent), or Italy (8 percent). In fact, American children spent more of their childhoods in stepfamilies than did children in continental Europe, Canada, or New Zealand. As a result, American children experienced not only more breakups but also more new adults moving in with the biological parent who cared for them.<br><br>� American women become parents at an earlier age and are much more likely to spend time as lone parents in their teens or twenties than are women in Western Europe. By age thirty, one-third of American women had spent time as lone mothers; in European countries such as France, Sweden, and the western part of Germany the comparable percentages were half as large or even less. But children born to lone parents in the United States are also more likely to experience a parent&#x2019;s new partner moving into the household than in some other countries, including France, Sweden, and Germany. So more lone-parent families started, and more ended.<br><br>What all these statistics mean is that family life in the United States involves more transitions than anywhere else. There is more marriage but also more divorce. There are more lone parents but also more repartnering. Cohabiting relationships are shorter. Over the course of people&#x2019;s adult lives, there is more movement into and out of marriages and cohabiting relationships than in other countries. The sheer number of partners people experience during their lives is greater. Jeffrey Timberlake has estimated the percentage of women in each country who had three or more live-in partners (married or cohabiting) by age thirty-five. These were women who may have lived with a man and then perhaps married him and had children, divorced him, lived with another man (partner number two), ended that relationship, and then lived with or married yet another man (partner number three). In most countries, the percentage of women who accomplished this feat by age thirty-five is negligible: almost no one in Italy or Spain, less than 2 percent in France or Canada, and 3 percent in Germany. The highest figures elsewhere were 4.5 percent in Sweden and 4 percent in New Zealand. But in the United States, 10 percent of women had three or more husbands or live-in partners by age thirty-five, more than twice the percentage in Sweden and New Zealand and several times the percentage anywhere else.<br><br>The Impact<br><br>From a child&#x2019;s perspective, experiencing three or more parental partnerships would imply a scenario such as being born to a lone mother who later marries the child&#x2019;s father, then divorces him and starts a cohabiting relationship, then ends that relationship and lives with someone else. The percentage of children who experienced three or more mother&#x2019;s partners by age fifteen in the mid-1990s was less than<br><br>2 percent in every other country except for Sweden, where it was 3 percent. But in the United States, it was 8 percent. So about one out of twelve American children saw at least this many transitions in their living arrangements. The number of children who experienced exactly two parental partnerships (but not three) is considerably higher, and again the United States led with 21 percent, compared to 16 percent in Sweden, 11 percent in Canada, and 8 percent in France. Nowhere else did children see so many adults come and go.</p><h2>Murder in the Bowery (A Gaslight Mystery)</h2><p><b>The latest Gaslight Mystery from the bestselling author of <i>Murder in Morningside Heights</i> finds Sarah Brandt and Frank Malloy searching for a connection between a murdered newsie and a high society woman with dangerous habits.<br><br></b>Frank Malloy&#x2019;s latest client is the well-dressed Will Bert.

The young man had introduced himself as Will Bert. He was a handsome fellow, sporting a fairly new suit of brown, checked fabric and a pristine shirt with a fresh collar. He had settled his smart-looking derby on his knee instead of leaving it on his head, as too many young men did today. He wasn&#x2019;t the usual sort of client who came to Frank&#x2019;s detective agency, but then his agency was also fairly new, so he really couldn&#x2019;t claim to have a &#x201c;usual&#x201d; sort of client.</p><p>&#x201c;How did you come to lose your brother, Mr. Bert?&#x201d; Frank asked.</p><p>Bert shrugged almost apologetically. &#x201c;Well, I didn&#x2019;t exactly lose him. It&#x2019;s kind of a long story.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going anywhere.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right then. Well, you see, Freddie and me are orphans. After our folks died, we had to look after ourselves, so I started selling newspapers to support us. Freddie did, too, even though he was still really small.&#x201d;</p><p>A common enough story, Frank knew. &#x201c;You were street arabs?&#x201d; he asked, referring to the hundreds of orphaned and abandoned children who lived on the New York City streets.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. We stayed at one of the Newsboys&#x2019; Lodging Houses whenever the weather was bad, of course, and I always looked out for Freddie, but it was a hard life. That&#x2019;s why we finally decided to go out West on one of those Orphan Trains.&#x201d;</p><p>The Orphan Trains had been taking children from the city out West to find homes since before Frank was born. &#x201c;I guess you were hoping to be adopted by some farmer out in Iowa or something.&#x201d;</p><p>Bert smiled a little at this. &#x201c;I know it sounds strange, especially for a city boy like me, but those people from the Children&#x2019;s Aid Society make it sound like a fairy tale or something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it wasn&#x2019;t a fairy tale for you and your brother, I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>Bert&#x2019;s smile disappeared. &#x201c;Not exactly. We went to Minnesota, not Iowa, although I don&#x2019;t guess it makes much difference. We wanted to go with the same family, but none of the families wanted me. I was too old, already sixteen, but Freddie was eight by then and still real cute, so he got picked right off. I ended up in another town with a storekeeper, Mr. Varney.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That was probably easier than farm work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess so. Mr. Varney, he never had any children, and he wanted somebody to take over his store when he was gone, so he trained me to do that. He wasn&#x2019;t going to adopt me or anything. He just put it in his will that I got the store when he died.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And did he die?&#x201d;</p><p>Bert seemed surprised that Frank had guessed. &#x201c;Yeah, he did, as a matter of fact. He just keeled over one day after we&#x2019;d unloaded some heavy boxes. The doc said there was nothing could&#x2019;ve been done. His heart gave out on him. So now I&#x2019;m a businessman, Mr. Malloy. I&#x2019;ve got a bright future ahead of me back in Minnesota, so naturally, I wanted to find Freddie and bring him to live with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought he&#x2019;d been adopted.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, they don&#x2019;t always go through with the legal adoption. The families, I mean. That&#x2019;s what I was counting on, anyway, but when I went looking for Freddie, I found out the family who got him decided not to keep him after all. He&#x2019;d been sent back to New York.&#x201d;</p><p>That seemed harsh to Frank, but he shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised at how cruel people could be. &#x201c;And nobody told you?&#x201d;</p><p>Bert shrugged again. &#x201c;Of course not. They probably didn&#x2019;t even know where I was. At least the family wouldn&#x2019;t, and the Children&#x2019;s Aid Society, what did they care?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And Freddie didn&#x2019;t write to you or anything?&#x201d;</p><p>Now he had the grace to look embarrassed. &#x201c;We was never much for writing letters, and I figured he was in a good place, being looked after, so what was the need? But when I found out he&#x2019;d been sent back here, I came to find him.&#x201d;</p><p>Finding one small boy in a city like New York would be a daunting task indeed. &#x201c;Have you looked?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I looked. I figured he&#x2019;d be selling papers in the old neighborhood, but now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He gestured helplessly.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yes, the strike.&#x201d; The newsboys had gone on strike a few days ago. They&#x2019;d done it last year when they thought the newspapers weren&#x2019;t treating them fairly, and this time they were trying to force both William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer to pay them better. The struggle between a gaggle of children and the two most powerful newspaper moguls in the country promised to be very interesting.</p><p>&#x201c;Right, the strike,&#x201d; Bert said. &#x201c;The newsboys are giving lots of speeches, but they aren&#x2019;t selling many newspapers, and none of them are on the corners where they usually are. They aren&#x2019;t even staying in the lodging houses.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess they aren&#x2019;t making as much money as usual with the strike,&#x201d; Frank said. The lodging houses charged the boys six cents a night and the same amount for dinner and breakfast if they chose to eat.</p><p>&#x201c;And with it being summer, they like to carry the banner anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Carry what banner?&#x201d; Frank asked, confused.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s what they call sleeping out on the street, carrying the banner. It&#x2019;s a matter of pride for the newsies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you want me to help you find your brother, Mr. Bert?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. I can pay. I told you, I own a store back in Minnesota, and I have money. Even still, I&#x2019;d do it myself, but with the strike, I figure it&#x2019;s going to take some time, and I can&#x2019;t be away from my store very long. I&#x2019;ve got someone minding it, but you know how it is.&#x201d;</p><p>Frank didn&#x2019;t know how it was. Luckily, he didn&#x2019;t even have to worry about his own business and getting paid like other private investigators did. Because of an accident of fate, he was now rich enough to only take the cases he liked, even if he didn&#x2019;t get paid at all, and Frank liked this case. He felt sorry for these two boys, being separated like that. He&#x2019;d let Bert pay to save the boy&#x2019;s pride, but Frank would give him a reduced rate. &#x201c;All right, I&#x2019;ll give it a try, Mr. Bert. I can&#x2019;t make any promises, though. You must know how hard it will be to find him. Do you know how long ago your brother came back to the city?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a couple years now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you know anything might have happened to him.&#x201d; Life in New York was uncertain at best, and for the boys who made their own way on the streets, it was downright dangerous.</p><p>&#x201c;Freddie&#x2019;s a smart kid. I know he&#x2019;s out there somewhere. I want to give him a good home, Mr. Malloy, the home we never had. Will you help me find him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll certainly try. What can you tell me about him? You said he&#x2019;s eight years old?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not anymore. That&#x2019;s how old he was when we went west. Now he&#x2019;s thirteen, I reckon. I don&#x2019;t have a picture of him, of course, but anybody who&#x2019;s met him will remember. See, when he was a little tyke, he almost got run over by a trolley. It cut off part of his foot, so now he only has two toes on his left foot. Makes him walk a little funny, and the other boys, they called him Two Toes. All the newsies, they like to give each other nicknames.&#x201d;</p><p>Frank had noticed that, although he&#x2019;d never given it much thought. &#x201c;When you said &#x2018;the old neighborhood,&#x2019; did you mean where you lived with your parents?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh no. Wouldn&#x2019;t sell many newspapers there, would we? I meant the corners where we used to sell our papers. Newsies are real jealous of their corners. If you try to horn in on another boy&#x2019;s spot, you&#x2019;ll likely find yourself beat up pretty good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for the warning,&#x201d; Frank said. &#x201c;So where were these corners where you used to sell?&#x201d;</p><p>Frank wrote down the streets on the pad he pulled from his desk drawer. &#x201c;And your brother&#x2019;s name is Freddie Bert.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;ll be much obliged to you, Mr. Malloy, and so will Freddie, when you find him.&#x201d;</p><p>For once, Frank might have a case with a happy ending.</p><p>The house sat in the middle of one of the worst slums of the city, mere blocks from the notorious Five Points neighborhood and surrounded by boisterous saloons and teeming tenements and places so wicked they didn&#x2019;t even have signs. The house itself was dilapidated and filthy, and the roof had holes. Rain had ruined one of the bedrooms, rats had taken over the cellar, and pigeons roosted in the attic.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take it,&#x201d; Sarah Brandt Malloy said.</p><p>The owner, a rather rascally-looking fellow in checked pants and a threadbare suit coat, looked her over in disbelief, taking in her expensive gown and stylish hat. &#x201c;Are you sure, miss?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect, isn&#x2019;t it, Gino?&#x201d; she asked her companion.</p><p>Gino Donatelli, her husband&#x2019;s partner in the detective agency, was functioning as her bodyguard today as she toured the latest offerings of ramshackle houses available for sale on the Lower East Side of the city. The young man looked around doubtfully. &#x201c;If you think so, Mrs. Malloy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course it isn&#x2019;t worth half of what you&#x2019;re asking, Mr. Bartholomew,&#x201d; she told the owner. She&#x2019;d been looking for months, so she was an expert now. &#x201c;I saw a larger place over on Mulberry Street for only a thousand.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Bartholomew began to sputter his outrage, but in the end he happily accepted Sarah&#x2019;s offer, as she&#x2019;d known he would, and made an appointment with her the following week to visit an attorney to sign the necessary papers.</p><p>&#x201c;May we drop you somewhere, Mr. Bartholomew?&#x201d; she asked when they&#x2019;d concluded their negotiations.</p><p>He eyed her carriage longingly. &#x201c;Thank you, miss, but I wouldn&#x2019;t want to be seen in such a fine vehicle on this street. People would start asking me for money.&#x201d;</p><p>Gino helped Sarah into the carriage, which actually belonged to her parents, and instructed the driver to take them to Sarah&#x2019;s home. When they were safely away, Gino turned to her with a perplexed frown. &#x201c;Are you sure you want to buy that place?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know it looks horrible right now, and it didn&#x2019;t escape me that someone had obviously been living in several of the rooms so we&#x2019;ll have to deal with that, but it&#x2019;s the perfect location. We aren&#x2019;t going to live there ourselves, remember.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, and I guess you&#x2019;re right. If you want poor women to find it, then it really is the perfect location. Is it going to be a hospital?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to call it a home for unwed mothers, so they can come to stay as soon as they need to, have their babies there, and stay until they&#x2019;re well again. We&#x2019;ll have a matron living in to watch over the girls and several midwives who will be available. They may even live in also and serve the rest of the community as well. I haven&#x2019;t figured that out yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have plenty of time to do that while you get somebody to fix the place up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, and I&#x2019;m thinking I&#x2019;ll put Maeve in charge of that.&#x201d;</p><p>Gino grinned. He was such a handsome boy, and he was so obviously enamored of their family&#x2019;s nursemaid, Maeve Smith. Sarah was pretty sure Maeve felt the same way about Gino, but Maeve wasn&#x2019;t one to give herself away. &#x201c;She did a pretty good job of managing the workers when you were fixing up your own house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Indeed she did. Without her help, Malloy and I would probably still be waiting for them to be finished.&#x201d; Sarah opened the fan hanging from her wrist and began to flutter it, trying to stir up some air inside the carriage.</p><p>&#x201c;You were right about bringing the carriage,&#x201d; Gino said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad we don&#x2019;t have to walk in this heat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or try to find a cab. My mother insisted we take it, and she was right, although I think she was more worried about our safety in this neighborhood than our comfort.&#x201d; Sarah glanced out the window at the street urchins running alongside the fine carriage, shouting for a handout. Her heart told her to throw some coins out the window, but her head told her that would only draw more children and encourage them to be bolder, endangering life and limb as they ran perilously close to the wheels and the horses. In the city, even charity could be dangerous. &#x201c;Thank you for coming with me today.&#x201d;</p><p>Gino grinned. &#x201c;I know you would&#x2019;ve been fine on your own, but Mr. Malloy worries.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know he does, even though I used to travel these streets alone at all hours of the day and night when I was called out to deliver babies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t have the right to worry then, but now that you&#x2019;re married&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;I have to admit, it&#x2019;s very nice to have someone worrying about me. Oh dear, what&#x2019;s going on here?&#x201d;</p><p>They both leaned to look out the window at a crowd of children gathered on the street corner. One boy stood on a box and appeared to be giving a speech while the rest of them cheered. Adults were stopping to listen and enjoy the spectacle.</p><p>&#x201c;Newsboys,&#x201d; Gino said.</p><p>&#x201c;Newsboys? Oh yes, I&#x2019;d forgotten. They&#x2019;re on strike, aren&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they call it. They aren&#x2019;t selling the World or the Journal, although I guess all the other papers are still available.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it looks like that one boy is giving a speech.&#x201d; Sarah stuck her head out the window to keep the newsboys in sight as their carriage pulled away from the corner.</p><p>&#x201c;He probably is. They have to keep the boys stirred up or they&#x2019;ll give in and start selling the papers again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why are they striking?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because of the cost of the papers. The boys used to buy them in bundles of ten for five cents, then sell them for a penny apiece, but last year during the war with Spain, the Journal and the World raised the price of the papers to six cents for ten. The boys didn&#x2019;t mind then because people were buying more papers during the war, so they were still doing well, but the war is long over and the two papers haven&#x2019;t lowered their prices.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not fair to the boys.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess it would be if they could charge more for the papers, but nobody is going to pay more than a penny for a newspaper, so they&#x2019;re stuck.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know a lot about it, Gino.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I used to sell newspapers when I was a kid. It&#x2019;s a hard life. I was lucky because I had a home and a family to go to every night, though. A lot of the boys are orphans.&#x201d;</p><p>Sarah nodded. &#x201c;Or even worse, they&#x2019;ve been abandoned by their families. I used to think all the children on the streets were orphans. I just couldn&#x2019;t believe that people would turn out their own little ones to fend for themselves. Then I came to understand that sometimes they have no other choice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s amazing how many of the kids seem to do all right, though. I&#x2019;ve seen boys as young as six or seven managing on their own. Of course, some of them end up in gangs, but the rest of them look out for each other.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the lodging houses help, too, I suppose. At least they don&#x2019;t have to sleep on the streets in the dead of winter.&#x201d;</p><p>Gino shook his head. &#x201c;The boys actually prefer sleeping on the streets. They like being able to come and go as they please. The lodging houses make you come in by nine thirty, but the boys like to stay out late and go to the theater.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The theater?&#x201d; Sarah exclaimed in delight.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, and then they go to a diner and have supper and smoke cigars and talk about the show.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had no idea!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The boys also don&#x2019;t like the way they&#x2019;re always preaching to them in the lodging houses, trying ...</p></p><h2>Jack &amp; Jill (Alex Cross, 3)</h2><p><b>Join Alex Cross in a heart-stopping thrill ride as he pieces together the clues of two gruesome murders.

Unlike the vast majority of country singers, songwriters, and musicians who made their fortunes working and living in Nashville, the often rebellious and always independent Owens chose to create his own brand of country music some 2 000 miles away from Music City &#x2013; racking up a remarkable 21 number-one hits along the way. In the process he helped give birth to a new country sound and did more than any other individual to establish Bakersfield as a country music center.<br><br>In the latter half of the 1990s, Buck began working on his autobiography. Over the next few years, he talked into the microphone of a cassette tape machine for nearly one hundred hours, recording the story of his life. With his near-photographic memory, Buck recalled everything from his early days wearing hand-me-down clothes in Texas to his glory years as the biggest country star of the 1960s; from his legendary Carnegie Hall concert to his multiple failed marriages; from his hilarious exploits on the road to the tragic loss of his musical partner and best friend, Don Rich; from his days as the host of a local TV show in Tacoma, Washington, to his co-hosting the network television show <i>Hee Haw</i>; and from his comeback hit, &#x201c;Streets of Bakersfield &#x201d; to his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame.<br><br>In these pages, Buck also shows his astute business acumen, having been among the first country artists to create his own music publishing company. He also tells of negotiating the return of all of his Capitol master recordings, his acquisition of numerous radio stations, and of his conceiving and building the Crystal Palace, one of the most venerated musical venues in the country.</p><p><b>Buck Owens</b>, born in Sherman, Texas, in 1929, moved to Bakersfield, California, in 1951. Between 1963 and 1972, Owens scored an incredible 20 number-one hits on the country charts. In 1969, he became co-host of <i>Hee Haw</i>, and 16 years after his last number-one hit, Buck returned to the top of the charts in 1988 with &#x201c;Streets of Bakersfield &#x201d; a duet with Dwight Yoakam. Inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1996, Buck Owens passed away on March 25, 2006.<br><b>Randy Poe</b> (Los Angeles) is the author of five books, including the bestseller <i>Skydog: The Duane Allman Story</i>. A Grammy-nominated record producer, he is president of Leiber &amp; Stoller Music Publishing and former executive director of the Songwriters Hall of Fame.In the latter part of the 1990s, country music legend Buck Owens spent close to 100 hours speaking into a tape recorder in an effort to document his life. Though Owens died before he was able to complete that task, record producer and author Randy Poe (Skydog: The Duane Allman Story) transcribed those tapes, assembling the stories here in chronological order. His dutiful efforts pay off in this insightful and engrossing read. Poe personalizes the narrator and gives readers a true sense of the voice of the hardworking musician who helped define the Bakersfield sound and influenced countless musicians. Growing up in labor camps and sleeping in the car after his family fled the Dust Bowl instilled a work ethic that never left Owens. His professionalism and business savvy would serve he and his band well, as he navigated dubious record deals, created his own publishing company, bought radio stations, a TV station, and three newspapers, all of which helped him tremendously when his star began to dim. The real treat is Owens' near-photographic memory, as he recalls countless recording sessions, shows, and chart positions for his many singles that he takes great pride in. Owens's tales of playing everything from a rowdy honky tonk (''if a fight breaks out, don't stop playing just start playing louder'') as well as Carnegie Hall make for terrific reading as well as a reminder of how the music industry used to function. Even readers unfamiliar with Owens's massive body of work will find this to be an immersive and informative look at one of country's most influential and surprisingly humble musicians. --Publishers Weekly<br><br>Buck 'Em is a good, chewy read...Anyone who knew Buck, or was sufficiently familiar with his voice...will hear his playful, high-baritone drawl rising from these pages...Fans of the performer and Bakersfield icon will eat it up. --Bakersfield Californian<br><br>...Buck 'Em! The Autobiography of Buck Owens feels like sharing a pint of whiskey with a rascal charmer who had 21 #1 hits and his song Act Naturally covered by The Beatles.... The latter part of the book deals with Owens' response to [Don] Rich s death, and it seems that he never really got over it. But his voice, even at its gravest moments, remains spirited, and full of spit and vinegar. --L.A. Weekly<br><br>...Remarkable...This fascinating read unspools a tale worthy of its musical pioneer. --Austin Chronicle<br><br>This book is a fascinating tale about an amazing performer. --Portland Book Review<br><br>''Drawn from almost 100 hours of cassette tapes recorded by Buck in the late '90s, this is not your usual tale of the dissolute country artist left penniless by management, booze or little white pills. Owens was a shrewd and hard working operator who chose to invest in music real estate and publishing when the money rolled in, building his own studio and buying and managing successful radio operations around his adopted town of Bakersfield. A fascinating story of a truly under-rated man.'' - Shindig!<br><br> ''The recently-published Buck Em'!: The Autobiography of Buck Owens feels like sharing a pint of whiskey with rascal charmer...'' --LA Weekly, December 3rd<br><br>''Grammy nominated producer and author Randy Poe was given the task of assembling hours of recorded speech into what has become the ultimate book on Buck Owens.'' - JP's Music Blog, November 27th <br> <br> "Had Owens lived to see his autobiography published, an editor or co-writer might have prodded him to round out some stories and explore avenues that he glossed over in his tapes. Regardless, Poe does a remarkable job of blending Owens tape recordings with interviews and other archival material to paint a vivid portrait of the singer that feels as authentic as if Buck had penned every word himself. Besides, given the way he comes across in Buck Em!, Owens seems like the type to know exactly what to say and how he wanted it said, and would freely tell an editor to go Buck themselves." - Rebeat Magazine <br> <br>"Owens' candor makes Buck 'Em a rewarding and frequently engrossing book. Like all autographers, and with Poe's help, he leaves out episodes he doesn't care to revisit and no doubt embroiders those he does, consciously or not. But he seems to have had an amazing memory he obsessively notes the chart positions of his many hits and exactly how long they stead there and he appears general careful with facts. Buck 'Em doesn't feel self-serving. For an autobiography, that s a rare accomplishment. As much as his remarkable story, Owens' unvarnished honesty makes this recast oral account of his life a mandatory addition for anyone with an interest in the history of country music." --Texas Music Magazine</p><h2>The Greenprint: Plant-Based Diet, Best Body, Better World</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and CEO of 22 Days Nutrition, Marco Borges introduces one of the most inclusive, practical, and revolutionary plant-based lifestyle plans - <i>The Greenprint</i>.

As the world becomes more aware of the benefits of plant-based eating than ever before in history, <i>The Greenprint </i>is more than a book&#x2014;it is a movement, and you&#x2019;re about to join.&nbsp;<br><br>As an exercise physiologist and the CEO and founder of 22 Days Nutrition, I&#x2019;ve dedicated my life to helping people live their best lives. This means encouraging people to transition to plant-based eating so they can lose weight, prevent (and in some cases reverse) chronic disease, boost their energy, and transform their health.<br><br>Why do I do this? Because I care about you, I care about my children, and I care about their children. I want to see you live your best and healthiest life. You see, in the last hundred years, our diets have radically changed&#x2014;for the worse. We&#x2019;ve gone from eating whole foods that nourish and heal the body to eating processed junk that is high in fat, sugar, additives, toxins, and fillers yet lacks vital nutrients. We&#x2019;ve gone from eating around 100 pounds of meat (which was raised on farms, grass fed, and free from chemicals) each year to, on average, more than 200 pounds, nearly all of it grown on factory farms and pumped full of antibiotics and hormones to satisfy the need for cheap, readily available meat. It&#x2019;s no wonder that, as a whole, we are the fattest and unhealthiest generation thus far.<br><br>And that&#x2019;s where the Greenprint movement comes in. It offers an extraordinary plan for how to eat to get fit and healthy with foods that are greener for the earth and better for you. What is unique about the Greenprint is that it gives you the essential steps you need to start thriving on plantbased eating and take it as far as you want to go to achieve all your health and weight-loss goals. You will discover the most effective way to transform your body and your life through plant-based eating, one meal at a time. The twenty-two Greenprint laws provide plenty of advice and inspiration, and you can begin to apply them one law at a time.<br><br>Along the way, you&#x2019;ll find a better way of eating and living&#x2014;and one that significantly contributes to the health and sustainability of the earth. You&#x2019;ll even be able to see tangible proof that your choices work: I&#x2019;ll give you a fun and easy tool to calculate your personal impact on the planet. So rest assured, you&#x2019;re about to go on an amazing journey with me, one that will help you live a longer, better life and make the world more livable for future generations.<br><br>Before I elaborate, I bet you&#x2019;re wondering, <i>What&#x2019;s a &#x201c;greenprint&#x201d;?</i><br><br>A greenprint is a measure of the impact of our food choices on our weight and overall health and on our planet. For example, let&#x2019;s say you switch to a 100 percent plantbased diet (I hope you do). The impact&#x2014;<i>the greenprint</i>&#x2014;of this change on your health can be measured in years: Studies show that plant-based people, particularly if they don&#x2019;t smoke and drink only a little, if any, alcohol, live four to seven years longer than people whose diets include animal products. It can also be measured in positive changes in health parameters: lower blood pressure, lower blood lipids, lower blood sugar, and lower weight. With regard to weight, on average, those who consume a plant-based diet are naturally twenty pounds lighter than their meat-eating counterparts.<br><br>As for your personal greenprint on the planet, it can be colossal. You can save animals, for example. Those that are raised for human consumption do not have great lives. Even if they are raised organically and free range, they have short lives with not much freedom. If you and your family ditch meat, dairy, and eggs, you can save two hundred animals a year, according to PETA.<br><br>From an environmental standpoint, expanding your greenprint through plantbased living saves an amazing amount of energy. We&#x2019;re all guilty of taking our sources of energy for granted. Just 1 calorie of animal protein requires 8.5 times more energy to raise than 1 calorie of protein from grains&#x2014;incredible! That&#x2019;s not even counting how much rain forest is cut down to create grazing land for animals each year.<br><br>Here's another way to look at it: The Greenprint is the dietary version of a &#x201c;carbon footprint&#x201d;&#x2014;the impact people and companies have on the environment, in terms of the greenhouse gases they have directly or indirectly caused, measured in units of carbon dioxide. CO2 is a major polluter and dramatically harms our environment by adding to the greenhouse effect and causing global warming. The Greenprint measures how your food choices impact your health as well as clears away your carbon footprint.<br><br>By following a plant-based diet, you can reduce your carbon footprint by 1,560 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents annually. This is a bigger reduction than if you switched from driving a gas-guzzling SUV to a hybrid-electric Prius.<br><br>You can even make a huge impact with the most incremental changes in your diet. Even if you ate one less hamburger a week for one year, this would be the equivalent of driving 320 fewer miles.<br><br>So just think of the impact on the environment if everyone in the country cut their meat intake by half and made up the difference with wholesome plant foods, such as whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds. That&#x2019;s why embracing meatless menus can mean a lot to our earth&#x2014; even if it&#x2019;s not every meal or every day.<br><br>Healthwise, your greenprint has an extraordinary impact on your health. Let me give a rundown of just some of the healthbuilding benefits of plant foods.

The revival in interest in the book came after it was linked, by Glenn Beck, to a Barack Obama 2012 campaign video called &#34;The Road We&#39;ve Traveled&#34;. Beck made several links between Obama&#39;s presidential goals and the themes in Chase&#39;s book: strong centralized government, Control of banking, credit and security exchanges, Underwriting of food, housing and medical care by the government, and Use of deficit spending to finance under writings among others. Another interesting literary tie in about the author was that early in his career he took a job with the Food Administration of the FTC with his fellow MIT classmates Walter Lippman, John Reed and T.S. Eliot. One of the cases Chase investigated at this post was corruption of the meatpacking industry with none other than Upton Sinclair. In 1942, Stuart Chase, in this book &#34;The Road We Are Traveling&#34; spelled out the system of planning the Fabian Socialists had in mind.</p><p>Stuart Chase was born in Somersworth, New Hampshire, on March 8, 1888, to public accountant Harvey Stuart Chase and Aaronette Rowe. His family had been living in New England since the seventeenth century.

After graduating, Chase became part of his father&#39;s accounting firm in Boston. Chase married Margaret Hatfield in 1914 and had two children. He and Margaret got divorced in 1929 and one year later he remarried to Marian Tyler.

His bestselling books include&nbsp;<i>Dear Dad: Letters from an Adult Child</i>,&nbsp;<i>Good�bye Jumbo . . . Hello Cruel World</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The F Word: How to Survive Your Family.</i>Writing to his late father, for whom he was named, the comic recalls growing up in small-town Minnesota as one of 11 children. It is the material of his comic routines, praised as gentle fun about a wacky family. The reader finds, however, that Anderson is an alchemist, transforming misery into the gold of his career. The family as revealed here was poor and abused by an alcoholic father, once a trumpet player with the Hoagy Carmichael band but whose later poor-paying jobs made him increasingly bitter. The author writes of siblings whose adult lives were badly affected by their drunken, hostile father whom they nevertheless remember with affection. In this poignant, touching memoir Anderson confronts his own insecurities and guilts and comes to understand the parent he had never been close to.

It has witnessed enormous flux in that time - not all of it for the better - but Hughes&#39; biography will likely make those who&#39;ve never visited want to book a plane ticket. * IRISH INDEPENDENT * With a broadcaster&#39;s delight, the historian Bettany Hughes throws herself into the gargantuan task of capturing the history of a city that spans 3,000 years, and whose story has been woefully neglected compared with other great urban centres...Impressive -- Louise Callaghan * SUNDAY TIMES * Hughes guides us round a city that is majestic, magical and mystical, leaving few stones unturned. It is a loving biography of a city that never stands still, never mind sleeps. Hughes has written an important book that brings the past of this glorious city to life. It is filled with charming vignettes and is snappily written. -- Peter Frankopan * THE OBSERVER Paperback of the Week * She populates her three cities of Byzantium, Constantinople and Istanbul with a rich cast, in a book that brims with brio and incident. -- Justin Marozzi * THE GUARDIAN * She deserves enormous credit for managing to traverse swathes of time (right down to the present day) with such aplomb. Rarely have I read a book in which I learnt more things that I really should have already known. -- Jonathan Wright * CATHOLIC HERALD * I can&#39;t think of a city with a more extraordinary history than Istanbul, and in Bettany Hughes it has its ideal biographer. -- Simon Shaw * MAIL ON SUNDAY * This scholarly work by television historian Bettany Hughes tells the city&#39;s story in rich and compelling detail * SUNDAY BUSINESS POST * Majestic and immensely enriching...It&#39;s a journey through conquest and greatness from Roman to Ottoman times and it reminded me of why I love the city. -- Roula Khalaf * FINANCIAL TIMES * Istanbul has endured an awful run of terrorist attacks and political disorder over the past few years so Bettany Hughes&#39; ebullient homage to the city is a welcome reminder of its long and fascinating history. * i NEWSPAPER * Historian and broadcaster Bettany Hughes has pulled off the feat of wrting about three empires in one book: the Roman empire of Constantine, the Byzantine empire which ended with the fall of Constantinople in 1453, and the Ottoman empire which lasted into the 1920s * THE OLDIE * Bettany Hughes&#39;s sprawling, 600-page love letter to one of the most inspiring cities on earth was a decadein the making, as befits a book covering millennia&#39;s worth of history in impressive detail. -- Alev Scott * PROSPECT * A witty and lavish account of a shimmering city caught between heaven and hell -- Noonie Minogue * THE TABLET * Istanbul has many inhabitants yearning to nurture their grand but asphyxiated city. In this tome - which begs a Turkish translation - Hughes gives them the time that Istanbul&#39;s pace, developers and officials do not. Her quiet confidence in the city&#39;s hard-earned cosmopolitanism soothes this concerned Istanbullu -- Sarah Jilani * ART REVIEW ASIA * Ground-breaking...There has been no recent large-scale history of the city with many names (Byzantium, Constantinople, Istanbul), which makes this colossal undertaking a notable achievement, coming at yet another turbulent moment in its long existence. -- Roger Crowley * LITERARY REVIEW * The complexity of the city&#39;s story is revealed in mesmerising detail in Bettany Hughes&#39;s new book. At times her writing feels like a love letter, or a eulogy to what has been lost. Her compassion for the city and its millions of inhabitants, past and present, comes across from the very first pages. It is quite rare to read a historical book that weaves research and insight with understanding and love: here is a book written as much with the heart as the mind...Here is an important book that must be translated into many languages - and especially into Turkish. -- Elif Shafak * THE SPECTATOR * Undoubtedly timely, because, as Hughes argues, Istanbul is once again central to the European narrative, as a postreligious secularism confront a resurgent religious movement. -- Michael McLouglin * IRISH TIMES * It is a delightful book for those who know Istanbul, but what a treat for those who do not, and are considering a visit. [Hughes] is an excellent, informed and good natured guide...she gets under the skin of the great city. -- Adrian Spooner * CLASSICS FOR ALL * Hughes suceeds triumphantly...and produces a cogent, passionate survey...bolstered by staggeringly wide-ranging research...[a] captivating book...Istanbul, a place where the past is impossible to miss...and few have told its enchanting story with Hughes&#39;s blend of precision and panache. -- Jon Wright * GEOGRAPHICAL, The Royal Geographical Society magazine * Hughes...wishes to show how the city&#39;s topography shaped the civilisations that grew from it - and how the many peoples that have passed through its walls went on to shape the lands and seas and trade routes of their known world...The thrill the author takes in her discoveries is infectious...Keen as she is to identify a past that is still omnipresent, she does not just like the city to a &#34;historic millefeuille&#34;: time and again she proves it...this heroic work...is the perfect read if - having noticed that Istanbul is increasingly in the news these days - you wish to know its place in the scheme of things, and what light it may case on the uncertain future we shall most certainly share. -- Maureen Freely * NEW STATESMAN * Istanbul&#39;s newly revived status as perhaps the major centre of Sunni Islam in the non-Arab world, and a pivot to the current Middle East imbroglio, is underlined by Bettany Hughes in the introduction to her sumptuous urban biography. -- Robert Fox * EVENING STANDARD * Bettany Hughes transports the reader on a magic-carpet-like journey through 8,000 years of history...[this is] the quintessential historical overview of a city racing up the modern politcal agenda. -- Richard Tarrant * THE LADY * The research is immaculate, as is the telling of it. * CHOICE * Bettany Hughes&#39; history of Istanbul through the ages is richly entertaining and impeccably researched. Hughes&#39; ebullient book is an ode to three incarnations of the city...[she] guides us round a city that is magestic, magical and mystical, leaving few stones unturned. It is a loving biography of a city that never stands still, never mind never sleeps...Hughes has written an important book that brings the past of this glorious city to life. It is filled with charming vignettes...snappily written...plenty here to entertain those who know something about the ciy and to enthrall those who don&#39;t. -- Peter Frankopan * THE OBSERVER * One of the pleasures of wandering the city today - whatever you call it - is in recognising that its layers of history are so enfolded with one another that they are impossible to separate. This is also the pleasure of Bettany Hughes&#39; highly readable jaunt through its past 2,500 years..Istanbul is still living history. Perhaps the most moving moment in the book comes when Hughes goes looking for the song of hte Janissaries...Hughes tracked down one of their descendants...Could he remember one of the Janissaries&#39; famous old songs? &#34;Yes he could - and out came a fluid, mellifluous prayer, a song from the religion of the road, a song of hope and revolution, of piety and of cosmopolitan human heartedness. It could be the city&#39;s anthem. -- Sameer Rahim * DAILY TELEGRAPH * For all its colourful drama, the city&#39;s history can be hard to narrate in a way that is coherent and gripping...Bettany Hughes [takes] up that challenge and...the result is impressive. In &#39;Istanbul: A Tale of Three Cities&#39; Ms Hughes plays intriguing, sophisticated games with time and space...by making unlikely connections between well-described locations and events separated by aeons, she gives voice to those witchy, diachronic feelings in a spectacular fashion. * ECONOMIST * A scholarly narrative, but Hughes isn&#39;t averse to heating it up with the salacious stories that dot the city&#39;s past -- Sameer Rahim * SUNDAY TELEGRAPH * Sweeping across eight millennia in its 800 pages, this glinting mosaic of a book is divided into short, vivid, episodic chapters...With 2017 marking the 500th anniversary of the Ottoman caliphate in Istanbul, this sumptuously produced history book is as timely as it is enthralling. -- Caroline Sanderson * SUNDAY EXPRESS * Over its 6,000 year history, Istanbul has been home to Phoenicians, Genoese, Venetians, Jews, Vikings and Azeris, and been the cornerstone of the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires...Hughes traces the history of one of the world&#39;s greatest cities. * GUARDIAN * Ten years in the researching and writing, it&#39;s a glittering mosaic of a history, packing the stories of three cities - Byzantium, Constantinople and Istanbul - into one volume, from their earliest settlement in 6000BC, to the 20th Century. -- Caroline Sanderson * THE BOOKSELLER * Award-winning historian Bettany Hughes pieces together the history of Istanbul in a riveting biography of a brilliant, bloodied city. -- Madeleine Keane * SUNDAY INDEPENDENT (IRELAND) * Fiery and magnificent new biography of Istanbul...Hughes does a fantastic job of cramming all this history into a fluid and engaging narrative. She also possesses a great turn of phrase, such as when she describes Haghia Sophia as seeming &#34;to be suspended by a golden chain from heaven&#34;...A gripping and erudite book. -- Stav Sherez * CATHOLIC HERALD * A magisterial new biography...Bettany Hughes transports the reader on a magic-carpet-like journey through 8,000 years of history...in a vivid narrative dotted with colourful characters and fascinating tangents...the quintessential historical overview of a city racing up the modern political agenda. -- Richard Turner * THE LADY * With a broadcaster&#39;s delight, Bettany Hughes...throws herself into the gargantuan task of capturing the history of a city that spans 3,000 years, and whose story has been woefully neglected compared with other great urban centres...Hughes reconstructs Byzantium, Constantinople and Istanbul as living, breathing landscapes...her scholarship is impressive...her enthusiasm radiates...Her subject...is irresistibly rich. The place known simply as &#34;The City&#34;, Hughes notes, has long lived a &#34;double life - as a real place and as a story&#34;...The tale she tells of the metropolis at the crossroads of the Earth is textured, readable and often compelling. -- Louise Callaghan * SUNDAY TIMES * Her latest book, Istanbul: A Tale of Three Cities, is a particular stroke of genius...Over the years the city has had three names - Byzantium, Contantinople and Istanbul so in a vivid rattle she hurls Xerxes, Alcibiades, Constantine, Justinian, Theodora, Suleyman the Magnificent and a sometimes overwhelming cast of thousands before us...It is a story well worth telling as the region continues to implode, the final or at least latest lashings out of the Ottoman Empire&#39;s collapse...The book is littered with historical echoes that...are impossible to ignore...there are wonderful anecdotes...She concludes with an encomium to Istanbul as a world city - literally, a cosmo-polis - where faiths and ethnicities are brought together by learning or trade...not an original thought but one that in this particularly troubled moment, for bomb-hit Istanbul and the rest of us, bears repeating. -- Richard Spencer * THE TIMES * Bettany Hughes&#39; Istanbul is built deliberately on what is passing as well as past. It is a story of numerous overlapping names, changes that often happened more slowly than the guidebooks tell us. Her subject is the city that was Byzantium for some 900 years, Christian Constantinopole for another 1,000, Islamic Islam-bol, then Istanbul - while also being New Rome, a Diamond Between Two Sapphires and The World&#39;s Desire...assiduous...passionate...there have beeen swirling tidal shifts around Istanbul since she began this book 10 years or so ago. She is celebrating citizenry of the world at a time when that idea is in retreat, damnming the &#34;otherness&#34; that the west has bestowed upon the east when throughout the world there are more and more &#34;others&#34;...She is a wistul and impassioned cosmopolitan who has produced a challenging story for 2017. -- Peter Stothard * FINANCIAL TIMES * This is historical narrative brimming with brio and incident. Hughes&#39;s portraits are written with a zesty flourish ... Istanbul is a visceral, pulsating city. In Bettany Hughes&#39;s life-filled and life-affirming history, steeped in romance and written with verve, it has found a sympathetic and engaging champion&#39; -- Justin Marozzi * GUARDIAN *</p><h2>Literature Unit: A Guide for Where the Red Fern Grows</h2><p>Pages perforated for removal and reproduction.</p><p></p><h2>The Fifth Kingdom</h2><p>This new edition of <i>The Fifth Kingdom</i> has been updated to reflect the most recent developments in mycology, including the field's adoption of a new taxonomical framework for fungi as a whole, and the latest advances in molecular genetics.<br><br> The chapter on fungicides has been updated to include new discoveries.

It is particularly important when an incident has occurred; when something has gone wrong. How do you respond to the people involved? What do you do to minimize the negative impact, and maximize learning? This third edition of Sidney Dekker&#x2019;s extremely successful Just Culture offers new material on restorative justice and ideas about why your people may be breaking rules. Supported by extensive case material, you will learn about safety reporting and honest disclosure, about retributive just culture and about the criminalization of human error. Some suspect a just culture means letting people off the hook. Yet they believe they need to remain able to hold people accountable for undesirable performance. In this new edition, Dekker asks you to look at 'accountability' in different ways. One is by asking which rule was broken, who did it, whether that behavior crossed some line, and what the appropriate consequences should be. In this retributive sense, an 'account' is something you get people to pay, or settle. But who will draw that line? And is the process fair? Another way to approach accountability after an incident is to ask who was hurt. To ask what their needs are. And to explore whose obligation it is to meet those needs. People involved in causing the incident may well want to participate in meeting those needs. In this restorative sense, an 'account' is something you get people to tell, and others to listen to. Learn to look at accountability in different ways and your impact on restoring trust, learning and a sense of humanity in your organization could be enormous.</p><p>Sidney Dekker (PhD Ohio State University, USA, 1996) is currently professor at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, where he runs the Safety Science Innovation Lab. He is also Professor (Hon.) of psychology at The University of Queensland, and Professor (Hon.) of human factors and patient safety at the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane. Previously, Sidney was Professor of human factors and system safety at Lund University in Sweden. After becoming full professor, he learned to fly the Boeing 737, working part-time as an airline pilot out of Copenhagen. Sidney is the best-selling author of a multitude of human factors and safety books in addition to Just Culture, including, most recently, The Field Guide to Understanding &#x2019;Human Error&#x2019; (2014), Safety Differently (2014), Second Victim (2013), Drift into Failure (2011), and Patient Safety (2011).Comments on previous editions: 'Readers interested in organizational ethics and decision-making will benefit from the case studies and examples. Summing Up: Recommended. Lower- and upper-level undergraduates; general readers.' Choice, February 2013 '...it is difficult to think of a more relevant and challenging book for health and safety practitioners, company managers and directors, regulators of all stripes, and members of parliament.' Safeguard, New Zealand, Jan/Feb 2013 'Sidney Dekker's book is a thought-provoking exposition of the concept of a just society. Would that we could achieve it! The questions that the author raises need to be discussed at all levels of government, and by judges and lawyers, and by ministers of health. Dekker makes it clear that profound changes must be made in both the legal and the medical systems if we really wish to improve medical safety.' John W. Senders, University of Toronto, Canada 'A timely book about the current major safety dilemma - how do we resolve the apparent conflict between increasing demands for accountability and the creation of an open and reporting organisational culture? Thought-provoking, erudite, and analytical, but very readable, Sidney Dekker uses many practical examples from diverse safety-critical domains and provides a framework for managing this issue. A 'must-read' for anyone interested in safety improvement, but also, one hopes, for politicians, law-makers and the judiciary.' Dr Tom Hugh. MDA National Insurance Ltd, Sydney, Australia 'With surgical precision Sidney Dekker lays bare the core elements of a just culture. He convincingly explains how this desired outcome arises from a combination of accountability and (organisational) learning. The real-life cases in the book serve to drive his arguments home in a way that will be easily recognised and understood by practitioners in safety-critical industries, and hopefully also by rule makers and lawyers.' Bert Ruitenberg, IFATCA Human Factors Specialist 'The airline industry is under immense pressure and is full of sometimes serious contradictions. Staff are told never to break regulations, never take a chance yet they must get passengers to their destination on time. Staff are also implored to pamper passengers yet told not to waste money. The contradictions are at worst a receipt for disaster and at best low staff morale and lead to dishonesty as staff fear consequences and for good reason. Just Culture is essential reading for airline managers at all levels to both understand the endless conflicts that staff face trying to deliver the almost undeliverable and to reconcile accountability for failure with learning from that failure. A soul searching and compelling read.' Geoffrey Thomas, Air Transport World 'This book is both well-written and well-structured. It gives multiple perspectives on the complex issues of a just culture. The author greatly emphasizes on the down side of the blaming and punishing culture, and consistently proposes the new view of human errors. The given real examples make the points of the author very clear and applicable. The story-telling approach is definitely complementary with the stimulating questions of which the author uses as his writing style. Beginners and students in the human error field may benefit the most because this book is easy to read but without ignoring the significant details. Nevertheless, all of the professionals in high risk organizations and those who work in the name of justice may find this book as a thought provoking book and particularly as a guidance to build better safety systems where a just culture is practised.' Newsletter of the Europe Chapter of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, September 2008 'This book is fascinating because it is simply written and makes you understand the world of the judiciary and why "an honest mistake" can become a crime. A must-read for every regulator and Ops Manager if we want to retain our present incident reporting systems as a major contributor to safety.' The Controller, 2008 'HF/E practitioners bring a unique perspective to professionals operating in a particular setting, and this book makes compelling reading for anyone interested in complex social-safety environments.' Ergonomics in Design, Winter 2009 'It is unusual to find a book about a highly complex, brain-taxing subject which is not only enlightening but also a pleasure to read.' RoSPA Occupational Safety &amp; Health Journal June 2009 '...this book could and should be read by the policy formers and decision makers of all medium and large enterprises. In doing so they will gain a great deal of insight into an area that has perhaps been neglected for too long. I cannot recommend this work highly enough.' Health and Safety at Work August 2009 'The author explains that unjust responses to failure are rarely the result of a bad performance; they are rather the result of bad relationships. He suggests that working on improving relationships between managers and employees, doctors and patients, the judiciary system and a profession, is one of the ways we could build a just culture.'

After decades of separation, the reunited men are each preoccupied by their own personal crises. One brother grapples with the recent suicide of his dearest friend, the birth of his disabled son, and his wife's increasing alcoholism. The other brother sets out to incite an uprising among the local youth against the disintegration of the community's culture and economy due to the imposing franchise of a Korean businessman nicknamed the "Emperor of the Supermarkets". Both brothers live in the shadow of the mysteries surrounding the untimely deaths of their older brother and younger sister, as well as their great-grandfather's political heroism. When long-kept family secrets are revealed, the brothers' strained bond is pushed to its breaking-point and their lives are irrevocably changed.

He is a contributor to <i>The Bible Today</i> and <i>Give Us This Day</i> published by Liturgical Press.</p>Patella&#x2019;s years of study in the Holy Land and first-hand experience at archaeological sites are evident in his numerous insights concerning history, geography and customs of Roman Palestine and the wider early Christian world. He also skillfully addresses literary and theological themes as he brings alive the Lucan Jesus. A valuable addition to the library of any student of the Third Gospel.Barbara E. Reid, OP, PhD, Catholic Theological Union, Chicago, Illinois <br><br>Patella&#x2019;s commentary helpfully underlines the Lukan themes of Jesus&#x2019; mercy towards sinners and outcasts, is especially strong on the historical dimensions of Luke&#x2019;s presentation of Jesus&#x2019; life, ministry, and death, and most insightfully highlights Luke&#x2019;s presentation of Jesus&#x2019; battles with and conquest over the powers of evil. Teachers, preachers, and the people in the pew will all reap a rich harvest from this clearly written work.Robert Karris, OFM, Head of Research, The Franciscan Institute, St. Boneventure University<br><br>Michael Patella shows restraint, judgment, and penetrating insight in the way he lays out four main literary themes: 1) Conflict with the Evil One, 2) the Great Reversal of Fortunes, 3) Division of <i>Those For</i> from <i>Those Against</i>, and 4) the Experience of the Joy of Redemption. By simply following Luke&#x2019;s remarkable story line, he shows how all four come up at the beginning, the middle, and, most strikingly, at the very end of the Gospel. By the end the reader can only say, &#x2018;Now I see.&#x2019; Rather than present Jesus&#x2019; teaching as a &#x2018;generalized ethics,&#x2019; he places it firmly in the context of the &#x2018;end-time&#x2019; proclamation of the Kingdom of god, and subtly guides the reader into the First Century World: socially, religiously, and culturally. In this he shows himself both a scholar and an educator.&#x201d;John Clabeaux, Creighton University, Omaha, Nebraska</p><h2>Hope Unseen: The Story of the U.S. Army&#39;s First Blind Active-Duty Officer</h2><p><b>The inspiring, unflinching true story of &#x201c;blind&#x201d; faith, as Major Scotty Smiley awakes in a hospital bed and realizes his world is permanently dark he must stretch his faith like never before.

The climbing guides issued it as an edict. &#x201c;If you need to go, use the restroom over there&#x2014;this snow doubles as a source of water at ten thousand feet. None of us wants to go redrinking yesterday&#x2019;s grape Gatorade after it spends the night in your bladder.&#x201d; Easy for them to say. &#x201c;Over there&#x201d; was no big deal when you could see. But for a blind guy? I might as well walk to Boise to take a pee; I had zero chance to make it two hundred meters. I had stuck a lot of unwanted things in my mouth during the last eight hundred or so days of darkness, so what was wrong with a tiny taste of lemon snow for a few people who could still see?<br> <br>The decision quickly became a dilemma. I follow rules. But to pee properly I needed help. I had been superexcited when the guide told our group that we would be waking up at eleven in preparation for the climb to the summit. It was just 9 P.M. Fourteen hours of sleep? Simply awesome. It was smart to allow us rest before we ascended the final four-thousand-plus vertical feet to the fifth-highest point in the continental United States. But my joy was soon turned to frustration: the guide explained that we would be arising at 11 P.M. Two hours? I don&#x2019;t mess around with sleep patterns&#x2014;even if my life now exists in a perpetual nighttime.<br> <br>By the time I decided that I could no longer hold it, the rest of the climbing team was knocked out. If I woke anyone up, I&#x2019;d be robbing him of probably half his night&#x2019;s rest. In a departure from my normal worldview, I became a utilitarian. The odds that someone would actually happen upon my urine were extremely low&#x2014;the Mariners winning the World Series low. Compare those minuscule odds and their minimal impact with the guarantee someone would lose sleep if I shook him awake, and the answer became clear.<br> <br>At just after 10 P.M., 10,100 feet above Enumclaw and Yakima and Fort Lewis&#x2014;feet freezing and teeth chattering&#x2014;I peed in the snow just a few steps behind the tent. Really, the dilemma was less about me stealing anyone&#x2019;s sleep and more about how much I hate&#x2014;how much I really despise&#x2014;my childlike dependency on others. With more than two years of blindness under my belt, maybe I should have been used to it, but I wasn&#x2019;t. Being helpless in certain circumstances never gets easy. The pain dulls a bit. But it&#x2019;s a lifelong challenge.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s difficult to admit, because I like to think of myself as noncompetitive, but the truth is I want to be the best at every endeavor I undertake. Deep down I want to march the fastest, pin the quickest, shoot with the most deadly accuracy, marry the prettiest girl, and climb the highest mountains. That&#x2019;s what happens when you grow up with three brothers and three sisters. You hone your quickness fighting for extra dessert. You build strength and awareness guarding your space in the car. My life growing up was a constant competition, and losing wasn&#x2019;t any fun. So I grew up trying to be the best.<br> <br>When Micah Clark, the founder of Camp Patriot, invited me on the Mount Rainier climb, I responded by asking him if he knew just exactly who (or what) he was talking to. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see, Micah.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>I can&#x2019;t.</i> I still trembled every time those words rolled off my tongue.<br> <br><i>I can&#x2019;t.</i> I won&#x2019;t testify with certainty, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure I never even used those words before the injury. I had won a state football championship&#x2014;as part of a team of undersized farm boys and wannabes, none of whom went on to play for a Division I school. I graduated from West Point with a decent grade point. I married my beautiful high school sweetheart. I completed Ranger School, and I set my sights on army Special Operations. I feel like I&#x2019;m a pretty tough guy. I spent my first twenty-four years tackling life head-on with a pretense of invulnerability, pounding life&#x2019;s obstacles into the turf and standing over them, satisfied, with mouth guard in hand. <i>I can&#x2019;t. Because I can&#x2019;t see Micah.</i><br> <br>&#x201c;I know you can&#x2019;t see, Scotty. But you can do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Micah Clark dreamed up Camp Patriot while fly-fishing in Montana after a three-month stint as a security contractor in Afghanistan. The luxury of a month in solitude&#x2014;with just his log cabin, his fly rod, and a stream&#x2014;convinced him that he should do something more for those who had returned from war a little less whole than when they had departed. He believed that outdoor adventures would be therapeutic for wounded vets, so he took a two-hour trip through <i>Non Profits for Dummies</i> and launched a dream that continues to shift the paradigm for many of our nation&#x2019;s most giving servants: <i>I can still be me.</i><br> <br>With Micah&#x2019;s encouragement, I managed to get over &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t&#x201d; and agreed to do the climb. Standard climbs up Rainier involve parking a van at about five thousand feet and then a day&#x2019;s walk to double that elevation. There is no real technical climbing involved in the first portion of the journey&#x2014;not even any snow until a few thousand feet up from the lot. The climactic moment of the first day came when another wounded vet and I crossed Pebble Creek. The creek crossing was nothing more than an exercise in staying dry for people with both eyes or both legs, but it proved a challenge for me. Michael Perry, a writer who joined us on the climb and later published an article in <i>Backpacker</i> magazine, described the dynamics: &#x201c;When they complete the crossing, there are congratulations and smiles all around, but the cheerleading is contained. Everyone is working out the line between encouragement and patronization. The men simply crossed a small creek.&#x201d;<br> <br>Compared to all the ruck marches I had done as an infantryman, the climb to base camp had not been all that difficult. Foolishly, I announced that to the group, prompting a quick and unfriendly &#x201c;Shut up, Scotty&#x201d; from an exhausted fellow climber. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you try it on one leg?&#x201d; was his remark. In no way was I reveling in my partner&#x2019;s struggles. To the contrary, I sheepishly apologized to him for my thoughtless comment. But the ease of the movement to base camp&#x2014;forty-pound backpack and all&#x2014;had emboldened me.<br> <br>The next day, two hours into the ascent from Camp Muir, my confidence had vanished, and I was vehemently disagreeing with Micah. I was not sure if I could keep going. Micah Clark&#x2014;as I remembered him from our years growing up in Pasco, Washington&#x2014;was an attractive guy, a human rock with a stomach that looked like German hedgerows. When I was a summer lifeguard, he would come to the pool to work out; he was training to become a Navy SEAL.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d once been in pretty good shape myself, but Ranger School and my levels of peak fitness were distant memories. Being blind made physical training a struggle. I found it tough to run up hills or to ride a bike. I found the monotony of pounding the pavement without the benefit of passing scenery too much to bear. And so my lungs were not the same as they had once been.<br> <br>In addition to my burning lungs, both of my calves were ablaze. I wanted to quit. I wanted an hour to hydrate. I was breathing like a chain smoker. I was mentally pummeled. I hoisted the cement pillars that were now my legs up the mountain one deliberate motion at a time. Every single step took Jedi-like concentration, tying my neck and shoulders in taut knots. I had no idea what each succeeding takeoff and landing of my foot would bring. Entertaining the notion that I might make it to the top, I considered the number of steps I still had to take. What was left? Thirty-five hundred feet? The equivalent of eight thousand more stairs? Except that climbing was entirely unlike walking up some steps and a lot more like navigating an angry, oscillating escalator&#x2014;in the wrong direction and with pieces of metal ready to jab my ankles at any moment.<br> <br>In my head, I scolded myself. <i>Why did you agree to do this? Why did you say yes?</i> How was I going to make it to the top&#x2014;and then back down again? When we paused for a break, I called out for my escort: &#x201c;Curtis, I&#x2019;m not sure I can keep going.&#x201d; I no longer believed I had any chance to summit the mountain.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see how you feel on the next stop, Scotty.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>This guy&#x2019;s not listening to me.</i> I made myself a bit clearer: &#x201c;Curtis, you don&#x2019;t understand. I don&#x2019;t think I can make it. You guys, um, you guys see these amazing views. You have some motivation to overcome the pain. Me, I don&#x2019;t see anything. I can&#x2019;t see anything. I don&#x2019;t know how much longer I can go.&#x201d;<br> <br>Curtis handed me a Snickers, some M&amp;M&#x2019;s, and a Propel. &#x201c;Here you go, Scotty. We&#x2019;ll see how you&#x2019;re doing at the next stop.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure how candy and flavored water were going to fix my fatigued body and my dwindling desire. In fact, I wasn&#x2019;t sure what was going to get me back on my feet. I had been in this spot so many times in the last couple of years. When I woke up from the blast in Iraq and couldn&#x2019;t see a thing, every single step became that much harder. It took determination to get out of bed and just take a shower. It took every ounce of me to learn how to send an e-mail. Daily, I had to make choices to continue on or to sit on the couch with my feet up and listen to the television. When I lost my sight, the linebacker who tackled life head-on&#x2014;that guy was knocked down. If a blind person tackles life head-on, he runs into things: lampposts, doors, other people. There are lots of things I <i>can&#x2019;t</i> do. But there were also lots of things I could still accomplish. I had surfed in Hawaii and skied in Vail. I was about to become a graduate student at Duke University. My life was not as easy as before. Many things were hard. I was learning how to dig deep and fight for things in a new way. And yet, as I sat there on Mount Rainier, I just didn&#x2019;t think I could do <i>this.</i><br> <br><br> <br>Two years prior to Rainier, and just three months after losing the use of both of my eyes while fighting the war on terror in Mosul, Iraq, I hit bottom with this battle to persevere. I was struggling to believe that God was still God. I know now that the God who loved me before the injury loved me just as much afterward. The God I hoped in but could not see was the same God I now hoped in despite being able to see nothing at all. But crumpled on a cement slab, in the vicinity of the V.A. Blind Rehabilitation Center in Palo Alto, California, I no longer understood what God wanted from me.<br> <br><i>What am I supposed to do with this life? Who am I?</i><br> <br>Somewhere along the sidewalk that led to the door of the blind center, my stick had missed a mat. I knew the whole route by heart&#x2014;had committed it to memory in just a week. Coming out of the gym, I felt around for a metal drainage grate. The grate was maybe twenty feet from the door, just an inch or two to the right of the five-foot-wide cement strip that kept me on course. The xylophone tinging of the grate told me to turn right. Another twenty feet took me to the first black mat&#x2014;three feet long and five feet wide; the rubber marker told me to take another left. About thirty feet after that turn, I would cross a small driveway&#x2014;a twenty-foot journey without the benefit of paralleling borders that required me to shoot my own straight arrow to the other side. It was my own personal game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey. Once across the driveway, I would use my stick to again find the sidewalk and resume the &#x201c;easy&#x201d; part of my travels.<br> <br>As best I can remember, I connected all of those dots precisely. Crossing the driveway had the most dramatic impact on my nerves. Parking lots were a blind man&#x2019;s outer space. No up, no down. No left, no right. Just an empty wasteland of concrete that could quickly induce massive disorientation.<br> <br>Whenever I made it those twenty feet, I breathed a sigh of relief, and on that particular day, I specifically remember exhaling. So it must have been the final waypoint that I missed. My walking stick&#x2019;s next encounter with a black mat meant I would turn right and proceed ten feet until I heard the sound of two automatic doors swinging open. But two minutes after crossing that driveway, I hadn&#x2019;t hit a mat. The stretch to the mat was not really that far&#x2014;thirty yards and maybe thirty seconds on a normal day. But two minutes? I figure I must have walked a football field. What was the stupid stick for if it couldn&#x2019;t find the mat? I raged against the idea of what I must have looked like with that stick&#x2014;a spectacle for sure. I was so angry with myself, with the situation, with my pathetic life that I stepped off the sidewalk in defiance. If I had learned one thing in the first week of mobility school, it was &#x201c;Never leave the sidewalk.&#x201d; <i>Forget it. I can do this.</i> I stepped into space and floated toward the moon.<br> <br>What I didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;because Tiffany was carefully picking her battles with me&#x2014;was that the blue-and-white hockey helmet protecting my brain from a blow to the soft part of my head came with a rainbow-colored chinstrap. I was a triangle-headed man with a stick that shouted, <i>I can&#x2019;t see,</i> and I wasn&#x2019;t even aware that it was all made worse by a chinstrap that announced my support for Skittles, trips to Hawaii, or a San Francisco parade. I wouldn&#x2019;t know until weeks later when my friend Adam Rivette visited. Tiffany stood across the room, waving her arms for Adam to be quiet, as Adam asked the obvious question. &#x201c;Scotty, dude, what&#x2019;s with the rainbow chinstrap?&#x201d; After Tiffany&#x2019;s sister Michelle hesitantly stuck her toe into the fray and confirmed that Adam wasn&#x2019;t just messing with me, I ripped off the helmet and chucked it across the room.<br> <br>I had never been to Palo Alto as a sighted person. I had certainly never been to the Blind Center. I had gone toe-to-toe with bullets and bad guys&#x2014;really bad guys. I had led soldiers in combat. Children at West Point used to look up to me. But sweltering between the mid-July California sun and the radiating pavement&#x2014;drifting listlessly in that lot&#x2014;I grew desperate. The blackness, the warmth, and a growing dizziness induced a panic beyond any other that I had ever endured. Before lifting weights at the V.A.&#x2019;s eighties-era gym, I had neglected to drink any water. I could feel my sweat glands drying up&#x2014;searching my body in vain for moisture&#x2014;as I wandered aimlessly, probing for something, anything, that might reestablish my bearings. It was dark. It seemed empty. I felt hopeless.<br> <br>I fought to stay conscious. Like a bat, I hurled sound waves, shouting &#x201c;hello&#x201d; in multiple directions (or what I thought were multiple directions), attuning my ears to any potential echo. But it was well after five. The government workers had all gone home; their punctuality angered me as I clawed at the nothingness for something.<br> <br>Probably another half an hour went by before I found a curb and its landing. The three-inch increase in elevation was enough to alleviate my fears of being mowed down by a sanitation truck or a spirited teenager fixated on the sounds of hip-hop. I stepped up onto the sidewalk, threw my horrible stick down, and burst into tears. I had lived through a car bomb, narrowly escaped the piercing death of hot bullets, and now I was going to die as a pathetic blind guy in a Silicon Valley parking lot?&lt;...</p><h2>The Michael Moorcock Library Vol. 2: Elric The Sailor on the Seas of Fate</h2><p><b>Collecting the second volume of the classic 1980's comic adaptation of the&nbsp;<i>Elric of Melnibon�</i>&nbsp;novels by Michael Moorcock!</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Forced to flee his city of Melnibon�, Elric and his sorcerous blade, Stormbringer, journey to the edge of a black sea where he begins a voyage that will bring him face-to-face with all the champions time can summon--and more!</p><p><b>Roy Thomas</b>&nbsp;is an American comic book writer and editor who was Stan Lee's first successor as editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics.

However, she captivated her audience with her first novel, <i>The Quicksand Pony</i>. In a starred review, School Library Journal called it &#x201c;a gripping adventure story, a tale of survival, an engaging mystery, a touching animal story, and a family saga.&#x201d;<p><b>Introduction<br><br></b>Procter and Gamble had a problem: it needed a new floor cleaner. In the 1980s, the company had pioneered one lucrative consumer product after another, from pull-up diapers to anti-dandruff shampoo. It had developed color-safe detergent and designed a quilted paper towel that could absorb 85 percent more liquid than other paper towels. These innovations weren&#x2019;t lucky accidents: Procter and Gamble was deeply invested in research and development. At the time, the corporation had more scientists on staff than any other company in the world, more PhDs than the faculties of MIT, UC-Berkeley, and Harvard <i>combined</i>.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, despite the best efforts of the chemists in the household- cleaning division, there were no new floor products in the pipeline. The company was still selling the same lemon-scented detergents and cloth mops; consumers were still sweeping up their kitchens using wooden brooms and metal dustpans. The reason for this creative failure was simple: it was extremely difficult to make a stronger floor cleaner that didn&#x2019;t also damage the floor. Although Procter and Gamble had invested millions of dollars in a new generation of soaps, these products tended to fail during the rigorous testing phase, as they peeled off wood varnishes and irritated delicate skin. The chemists assumed that they had exhausted the chemical possibilities.<br></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#x2019;s when Procter and Gamble decided to try a new approach. The company outsourced its innovation needs to Continuum, a design firm with offices in Boston and Los Angeles. &#x201c;I think P and G came to us because their scientists were telling them to give up,&#x201d; says Harry West, a leader on the soap team and now Continuum&#x2019;s CEO. &#x201c;So they told us to think crazy, to try to come up with something that all those chemists couldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Continuum designers didn&#x2019;t begin with molecules. They didn&#x2019;t spend time in the lab worrying about the chemistry of soap. Instead, they visited people&#x2019;s homes and watched dozens of them engage in the tedious ritual of floor cleaning. The designers took detailed notes on the vacuuming of carpets and the sweeping of kitchens. When the notes weren&#x2019;t enough, they set up video cameras in living rooms. &#x201c;This is about the most boring footage you can imagine,&#x201d; West says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s movies of mopping, for God&#x2019;s sake. And we had to watch hundreds of hours of it.&#x201d; The videotapes may have been tedious, but they were also essential, since West and his team were trying to observe the act of floor cleaning without any preconceptions. &#x201c;I wanted to forget everything I knew about mops and soaps and brooms,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I wanted to look at the problem as if I&#x2019;d just stepped off a spaceship from Mars.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several months of observation &#x2014; West refers to this as the anthropologist phase &#x2014; the team members had their first insight. It came as they watched a woman clean her mop in the bathtub. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got this unwieldy pole,&#x201d; West says. &#x201c;And you are splashing around this filthy water trying to get the dirt out of a mop head that&#x2019;s been expressly designed to <i>attract</i> dirt. It&#x2019;s an extraordinarily unpleasant activity.&#x201d; In fact, when the Continuum team analyzed the videotapes, they found that people spent more time cleaning their mops than they did cleaning the floors; the tool made the task more difficult. &#x201c;Once I realized how bad mopping was, I became quite passionate about floor cleaning,&#x201d; West says. &#x201c;I became convinced that the world didn&#x2019;t need an improved version of the mop. Instead, it needed a total replacement for the mop. It&#x2019;s a hopeless piece of technology.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Continuum designers couldn&#x2019;t think of a better cleaning method. It seemed like an impossible challenge. Perhaps floor cleaning was destined to be an inefficient chore. In desperation, the team returned to making house visits, hoping for some errant inspiration. One day, the designers were watching an elderly woman sweep some coffee grounds off the kitchen floor. She got out her hand broom and carefully brushed the grounds into a dustpan. But then something interesting happened. After the woman was done sweeping, she wet a paper towel and wiped it over the linoleum, picking up the last bits of spilled coffee. Although everyone on the Continuum team had done the same thing countless times before, this particular piece of dirty paper led to a revelation.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the designers saw in that paper towel was the possibility of a disposable cleaning surface. &#x201c;All of a sudden, we realized what needed to be done,&#x201d; says Don Buchner, a Continuum vice president. &#x201c;We needed to invent a spot cleaner that people could just throw away. No more cleaning mop heads, no more bending over in the bathtub, no more buckets of dirty water. <i>That</i> was our big idea.&#x201d; A few weeks later, this epiphany gave rise to their first floor-cleaning prototype. It was a simple thing, just a slender plastic stick connected to a flat rectangle of Velcro to which disposable pieces of electrostatic tissue were attached. A spray mechanism was built into the device, allowing people to wet the floor with a mild soap before they applied the wipes. (The soap was mostly unnecessary, but it smelled nice.) &#x201c;You know an idea has promise when it seems obvious in retrospect,&#x201d; West says. &#x201c;Why splash around dirty water when you can just wipe up the dirt? And why would you bother to clean this surface? Why not just throw it away, like a used paper towel?&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procter and Gamble, however, wasn&#x2019;t thrilled with the concept. The company had developed a billion-dollar market selling consumers the latest mops and soaps. They didn&#x2019;t want to replace that business with an untested cleaning product. The first focus groups only reinforced the skepticism. When Procter and Gamble presented consumers with a sketch of the new cleaning device, the vast majority of people rejected the concept. They didn&#x2019;t want to throw out their mops or have to rely on a tool that was little more than a tissue on a stick. They didn&#x2019;t like the idea of disposable wipes, and they didn&#x2019;t understand how all that dirt would get onto the moistened piece of paper. And so the idea was shelved; Procter and Gamble wasn&#x2019;t going to risk market share on a radical new device that nobody wanted.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the designers at Continuum refused to give up &#x2014; they were convinced they&#x2019;d discovered the mop of the future. After a year of pleading, they persuaded Procter and Gamble to let them show their prototype to a focus group. Instead of just reading a description of the product, consumers could now play with an &#x201c;experiential model&#x201d; clad in roughly cut plastic. The prototype made all the difference: people were now enthralled by the cleaning tool, which they tested out on actual floors. In fact, the product scored higher in focus-group sessions than any other cleaning device Procter and Gamble had ever tested. &#x201c;It was off the charts,&#x201d; Buchner says. &#x201c;The same people who hated the idea when it was just an idea now wanted to take the thing home with them.&#x201d; Furthermore, tests by Procter and Gamble demonstrated that the new product cleaned the floor far better than sponge mops, string mops, or any other kinds of mops. According to the corporate scientists, the &#x201c;tissue on a stick&#x201d; was one of the most effective floor cleaners ever invented.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, nearly three years after West and his designers began making their videotapes, Procter and Gamble officially submitted an application for a U.S. patent. In the early spring of 1999, the new cleaning tool was introduced in supermarkets across the country. The product was an instant success: by the end of the year, it had generated more than $500 million in sales. Numerous imitators and spinoffs have since been introduced, but the original device continues to dominate the post-mop market, taking up an ever greater share of the supermarket aisle. Its name is the Swiffer.</p> <p>The invention of the Swiffer is a tale of creativity. It&#x2019;s the story of a few engineers coming up with an entirely new cleaning tool while watching someone sweep up some coffee grounds. In that flash of thought, Harry West and his team managed to think differently about something we all do every day. They were able to see the world as it was &#x2014; a frustrating place filled with tedious chores &#x2014; and then envision the world as it might be if only there were a better mop. That insight changed floor cleaning forever.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is about how such moments happen. It is about our most important mental talent: the ability to imagine what has never existed. We take this talent for granted, but our lives are defined by it. There is the pop song on the radio and the gadget in your pocket, the art on the wall and the air conditioner in the window. There is the medicine in the bathroom and the chair you are sitting in and this book in your hand.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, although we are always surrounded by our creations, there is something profoundly mysterious about the creative process. For instance, why did Harry West come up with the Swiffer concept after watching that woman wipe the floor with the paper towel? After all, he&#x2019;d done it himself on numerous occasions. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t begin to explain why the idea arrived then,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I was too grateful to ask too many questions.&#x201d; The sheer secrecy of creativity &#x2014; the difficulty in understanding how it happens, even when it happens to us &#x2014; means that we often associate breakthroughs with an external force.

We started cooking and developing recipes during the test kitchen&#x2019;s early days, when we were just starting our careers. Now, nearly 20 years later, we are the hosts of the company&#x2019;s two hugely popular TV shows. Along the way, we&#x2019;ve developed a lot of recipes and cooked hundreds more on set. People always ask us which recipes are our favorites and why. Our new special collection,Cooking at Home with Bridget and Julia, answers that very question. It features 150 recipes (75 from each of us) from the test kitchen&#x2019;s archives that we cook at home time and time again. The process of choosing and writing about these recipes has led us on an interesting journey because the recipes we love are connected to how and where we were raised, where we have traveled, and what we like to cook for our husbands and children. So you&#x2019;ll learn more about us by reading this book. Personal facts abound in the narratives accompanying each recipe, like how Bridget became addicted to Indian food on a trip to Scotland to meet her future husband&#x2019;s parents, which is why she picked Chicken Tikka Masala. A family trip to Tuscany in her teens showed Julia the power of a simple fresh tomato sauce, which is why she chose Skillet Campanelle with Fresh Tomato Sauce, a recipe that brings her back to that time and place whenever she makes it.<br> Cooking for us is about feeding family and friends. And since we like to pull out all the stops on occasion, you&#x2019;ll find a chapter devoted to holiday celebrations as well as one covering casual entertaining. We tell you which appetizers make the cut for our parties (Bacon and Chive Deviled Eggs and Stuffed Mushrooms with Boursin and Prosciutto); which main courses never disappoint (Pasta with Classic Bolognese and Slow-Roasted Pork Shoulder with Peach Sauce); which stunning desserts are a must on our holiday table (Coconut Layer Cake and Goat Cheese and Lemon Cheesecake with Hazelnut Crust); and much, much more. In addition, as working mothers, we have to put dinner on the table every night so we appreciate rock-solid, easy-to-execute recipes: Spaghetti with Turkey-Pesto Meatballs is on heavy rotation at Julia&#x2019;s house while Thai Pork Lettuce Wraps are a favorite of Bridget&#x2019;s two sons.

In the tradition of her bestseller <i>The Three Snow Bears</i>, Jan Brett finds inspiration for her version of a familiar story in Namibia, where red rock mountains and vivid blue skies are home to appealing little dassies and hungry eagles.<p> Mimbi, Pimbi and Timbi hope to find "a place cooler, a place less crowded, a place safe from eagles!" to build their new homes. The handsomely dressed Agama Man watches from the borders as the eagle flies down to flap and clap until he blows a house down. But in a deliciously funny twist, that pesky eagle gets a fine comeuppance!</p><p> Bold African patterns and prints fill the stunning borders, but it is the dassies in their bright, colorful dresses and hats that steal the show in this irresistible tale, perfect for reading aloud.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p>With over thirty four million books in print, Jan Brett is one of the nation's foremost author illustrators of children's books.

In this &#x201c;Three Little Pigs&#x201d; adaptation, three dassies strike out to make new homes. While Timbi takes the time to construct a solid stone dwelling, hasty siblings Mimbi and Pimbi use grass and sticks, respectively. After being pursued by an eagle, the dassies&#x2019; natural predator (playing the wolf&#x2019;s traditional role here), Mimbi and Pimbi find shelter at Timbi&#x2019;s, where a blast from the chimney sends the villainous bird &#x201c;home for a nap,&#x201d; wrapping up the tale with a nonviolent end. The familiar plotline is extended in the intricate watercolor-and-gouache artwork in Brett&#x2019;s signature triptych layout: each central panel reflects the action described in the text, while wordless panels on either side show equally involving scenes, all handsomely framed by depictions of cloth, beadwork, and vegetation. Brett invokes the African setting with details of the desert landscape and the animals&#x2019; colorful, patterned clothing. The last page turns the story into an inspired pourquoi tale about dassies&#x2019; habitat and the sootlike coloring of native eagles.

Durling's earlier translations of the <em>Inferno</em> and the <em>Purgatorio</em> garnered high praise, and with this superb version of the <em>Paradiso</em> readers can now traverse the entirety of Dante's epic poem of spiritual ascent with the guidance of one of the greatest living Italian-to-English translators. <br><br>Reunited with his beloved Beatrice in the <em>Purgatorio</em>, in the <em>Paradiso</em> the poet-narrator journeys with her through the heavenly spheres and comes to know "the state of blessed souls after death." As with the previous volumes, the original Italian and its English translation appear on facing pages. Readers will be drawn to Durling's precise and vivid prose, which captures Dante's extraordinary range of expression--from the high style of divine revelation to colloquial speech, lyrical interludes, and scornful diatribes against corrupt clergy. <br><br>This edition boasts several unique features. Durling's introduction explores the chief interpretive issues surrounding the <em>Paradiso</em>, including the nature of its allegories, the status in the poem of Dante's human body, and his relation to the mystical tradition. The notes at the end of each canto provide detailed commentary on historical, theological, and literary allusions, and unravel the obscurity and difficulties of Dante's ambitious style . An unusual feature is the inclusion of the text, translation, and commentary on one of Dante's chief models, the famous cosmological poem by Boethius that ends the third book of his <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em>. A substantial section of Additional Notes discusses myths, symbols, and themes that figure in all three cantiche of Dante's masterpiece. Finally, the volume includes a set of indexes that is unique in American editions, including Proper Names Discussed in the Notes (with thorough subheadings concerning related themes), Passages Cited in the Notes, and Words Discussed in the Notes, as well as an Index of Proper Names in the text and translation. Like the previous volumes, this final volume includes a rich series of illustrations by Robert Turner.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert M. Durling</strong> is Professor Emeritus of English and Italian Literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz. <strong>Ronald L. Martinez</strong> is Professor of Italian at Brown University. Their works together include Dante's <em>Inferno</em> and <em>Purgatorio</em> and <em>Time and the Crystal: Studies in Dante's "Rime</em> <em>petrose."</em><br><strong>Robert Turner</strong> has been a professional illustrator for thirty years.<br><br>"As Durling and Martinez complete their monumental three-volume presentation of Dante's masterpiece, we can sense their triumph and elation, despite their characteristic modesty. This, after all, is the volume with which they can demonstrate the fullness and consistency of Dante's great project, its final approach to what they describe in one footnote as 'a pitch of intensity unique in all literature.' The scholarship, as always, is graceful, comprehensive, and acute, and it surrounds a translation that is so carefully considered and fully realized as to be, at times, quite breathtaking."--David Young, translator of <em>The Poetry of Petrarch</em><p></p><br>"Durling and Martinez deliver <em>Paradiso</em> in elegant English prose faithful to Dante's Italian. The general introduction and succinct notes to each canto enable an informed reading of a frequently daunting text, while the longer 'Additional Notes,' bibliography, and indices will more than satisfy the most exigent critic. Marvelous, in the richest medieval sense of the term."--Michael Wyatt, author of <em>The Italian Encounter with Tudor England</em><p></p><br>"At the end of his poem Dante claims that his 'high imagining failed of power,' but Durling and Martinez have suffered no such fate in completing their translation of the <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Their <em>Paradiso</em> is a crowning achievement, a work of lucid prose and of impeccable accuracy. Readers will find themselves rewarded by the succinct, richly informative notes at the end of each canto and the extended essay-notes at the back of the volume. A splendid accomplishment."--Richard Lansing, editor of <em>The Dante Encyclopedia</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Free: Why Science Hasn&#39;t Disproved Free Will</h2><p>Does free will exist? The question has fueled heated debates spanning from philosophy to psychology and religion. The answer has major implications, and the stakes are high. To put it in the simple terms that have come to dominate these debates, if we are free to make our own decisions, we are accountable for what we do, and if we aren't free, we're off the hook.<br><br>There are neuroscientists who claim that our decisions are made unconsciously and are therefore outside of our control and social psychologists who argue that myriad imperceptible factors influence even our minor decisions to the extent that there is no room for free will. According to philosopher Alfred R. Mele, what they point to as hard and fast evidence that free will cannot exist actually leaves much room for doubt. If we look more closely at the major experiments that free will deniers cite, we can see large gaps where the light of possibility shines through.<br><br>In <em>Free: Why Science Hasn't Disproved Free Will</em>, Mele lays out his opponents' experiments simply and clearly, and proceeds to debunk their supposed findings, one by one, explaining how the experiments don't provide the solid evidence for which they have been touted. There is powerful evidence that conscious decisions play an important role in our lives, and knowledge about situational influences can allow people to respond to those influences rationally rather than with blind obedience.<br><br>Mele also explores the meaning and ramifications of free will. What, exactly, does it mean to have free will -- is it a state of our soul, or an undefinable openness to alternative decisions? Is it something natural and practical that is closely tied to moral responsibility? Since evidence suggests that denying the existence of free will actually encourages bad behavior, we have a duty to give it a fair chance.<br></p><p><br><strong>Alfred R. Mele</strong> is the William H. and Lucyle T. Werkmeister Professor of Philosophy at Florida State University. He is the author of eight previous Oxford books, including <em>Free Will and Luck</em> (2006), <em>Effective Intentions</em> (2009), <em>Backsliding</em> (2012), and <em>A Dialogue on Free Will and Science</em> (2013). He also is the editor or co-editor of five OUP books, including <em>The Philosophy of Action</em> (1997) and <em>Free Will and Consciousness: How Might They Work?</em> (2010).<br><br>"...his book is a model of accessible philosophical argument." --<em>New Statesman</em> <br><p></p><br>"Alfred Mele's beautifully written and easily accessible book is a perfect tonic to the many recent claims by scientists that there is no such thing as free will. Mele has written a book for everyone, including specialists in the sciences and in philosophy, as well as a much wider audience. Indeed, any thoughtful layperson will profit from reading this book, learning first why a range of scientific studies are taken to prove that no one has free will, and then why these studies actually fail to do so. <em>Free</em> is interdisciplinary inquiry at its finest. Mele truly shows how contemporary philosophy and the sciences can learn from one another, and why doing so is so very enriching." <br>--Michael McKenna, University of Arizona <br><p></p><br>"Mele provides a devastating critique of the typical grounds for skepticism about free will that arise from work in neuroscience and psychology. Even better, Mele's discussion is straightforward and accessible to non-specialists and specialists alike. It is the first thing anyone should read to get a sense of the state of play on the relevance of science to questions of free will." <br>--Manuel Vargas, University of San Francisco <br><p></p><br>"As director of the Big Questions on Free Will project and author of many books on the topic, Al Mele has been at the forefront of contemporary philosophers exploring the implications of recent research in neuroscience and psychology for philosophical debates about free will. In <em>Free</em>, he surveys the key results of these explorations in an accessible book that will engage students and non-specialists, while at the same time providing a useful overview of the issues for specialists as well. New research in neuroscience and psychology forces us to refine our thinking about free will. But Mele makes a strong case that this research does not undermine all modern views about it, and he does so in straightforward, understandable discussions of the research and its implications in this short, informative book." <br>--Robert Kane, University of Texas at Austin<p></p><br></p><h2>A Conversation, Book 1: English in Everyday Life, 4th Edition</h2><p>NOTE:This is a standalone book.<br><br>A Conversation Book 1: English in Everyday Life, by Tina Kasloff Carver and Sandra D.

You can see the hills of northern Kentucky and the rooftops of Ripley&#x2019;s riverfront houses. And you can see what the abolitionist John Rankin saw from his house at the top of that hill, where for nearly forty years he placed a lantern each night to guide fugitive slaves to freedom beyond the river.<br> <br>In <i>Beyond the River</i>, Ann Hagedorn tells the remarkable story of the participants in the Ripley line of the Underground Railroad, bringing to life the struggles of the men and women, black and white, who fought &#x201c;the war before the war&#x201d; along the Ohio River. Determined in their cause, Rankin, his family, and his fellow abolitionists&#x2014;some of them former slaves themselves&#x2014;risked their lives to guide thousands of runaways safely across the river into the free state of Ohio, even when a sensational trial in Kentucky threatened to expose the Ripley &#x201c;conductors.&#x201d; Rankin, the leader of the Ripley line and one of the early leaders of the antislavery movement, became nationally renowned after the publication of his Letters on American Slavery, a collection of letters he wrote to persuade his brother in Virginia to renounce slavery.<br> <br>A vivid narrative about memorable people, Beyond the River is an inspiring story of courage and heroism that transports us to another era and deepens our understanding of the great social movement known as the Underground Railroad.</p><p>Ann Hagedorn has been a staff writer for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and has taught writing at Northwestern University&#x2019;s Medill School of Journalism and at Columbia University&#x2019;s Graduate School of Journalism. Her previous books are <i>Wild Ride, Ransom</i>, <i>Beyond the River</i>, and <i>Savage Peace</i>.<b>Chapter Eleven: Mobocracy</b> <p> One hundred ninety-two delegates from antislavery societies throughout the state of Ohio journeyed to the village of Granville on April 25 and 26, 1836. Most entered the town on the very wide road known as Broadway. Past the dogwood trees that had just begun to display their pink-and-white splendor up and down Granville's main streets; past the stately houses where women and children stood in their yards to watch the reputed troublemakers, as if the ragtag troops from some distant army had invaded the town; and past the dozens of strangers from neighboring towns leaning against buildings and hitching posts, malingering and scheming, drinking and waiting. Many had never ventured farther than twenty-five miles from home, and now, in dedication to the cause they risked their lives to advance, they had traveled a hundred miles and more to this seemingly peaceful and innocent town. </p><p> Nestled among the ridges, spurs, and hollows of the hills rising above Raccoon Creek, the middle fork of the Licking River, Granville was situated at nearly the center of the state of Ohio: hence the choice of the town for this meeting of delegates from all parts of the state. By the spring of 1836, Granville was largely an antislavery town surrounded by small, intense enclaves of proslavery zealots. It was the home of two schools, the Granville Literary and Theological Institution for men, and, for women, the Granville Female Seminary. And there were several safe houses for fugitives, well known among those who worked in the underground movement. Passions had been aroused the year before, in both the academic and residential communities, when Theodore Weld passed through Granville on his statewide tour. Speaking for three nights in a row, he barbed the conscience of the town as he dodged a steady stream of rotten eggs. One of the nights, he spoke near an open window and was repeatedly covered with eggs. Each time, he would wipe the slush from his face and clothing and barely miss a beat. </p><p> Granville's roster of antislavery advocates expanded after Weld's tour, but most of the peace-loving citizens of this quiet village considered themselves to be antiabolitionists and wanted nothing to do with what they believed to be a fanatical movement. Although they did not condone slavery -- and, indeed, considered themselves antislavers -- they also did not know how to end it. Many favored gradual emancipation, and many more were advocates of colonization. And so, in November 1835, during the very same days when Rankin, Campbell, Gilliland, and others in Ripley were discussing how to shape their convictions into the context of a constitution for their new antislavery society, another group of men with a different set of values was meeting in Granville. </p><p> There, at the Methodist church, twenty-six leaders of the community, all considered men of conscience as well as property, discussed what they could do to discourage the now-imminent invasion of their town by hundreds of abolitionists. They compiled nine resolutions. And after reassuring each other that they ardently believed in freedom of speech, they wrote: "We consider discussions [that] from their nature tend to inflame the public mind -- to introduce discord and contention into neighborhoods, churches, and literary institutions, and put in jeopardy the lives and property of our fellow citizens -- to be at varience with all rules of moral duty and every suggestion of humanity." Although they condemned slavery as a menacing evil, they were critical of the abolitionists for scaring slaveholders into strengthening their opposition to emancipation. The measures of the abolitionists, they said, dangerously "strengthen and rivet the chains of the slaves and perpetuate their bondage." </p><p> Worse still, they agreed, the abolitionists should not use strident language such as "man stealers," nor should they suggest that Negroes could be educated and one day achieve a place of equality. Such beliefs were "utterly vain and delusive." </p><p> They praised the efforts of the American Colonization Society and approved its plans to transport free blacks from the U.S. to Africa, saying that "the unwillingness of the blacks of this country to emigrate to Africa is one of the strongest evidences of that degradation and imbecility which naturally results from their condition while resident among the whites." And on March 31, 1836, the <i>Gazette</i> of Newark, Ohio, published a proclamation signed by the mayor, village clerk, council members, and sixty-nine other citizens of Granville urging against the upcoming abolition convention. </p><p> By the morning of April 27, men from the towns and hamlets around Granville began to gather in the taverns, back alleys, and tree-lined streets of the town while the big barn north of town owned by Ashley Bancroft and dubbed by the abolitionists as the "Hall of Freedom" was coming alive with the spirit and sounds of solidarity. That the energy and passions of both groups would eventually collide seemed inevitable. </p><p> It was after the townsfolk had rejected all requests for space for the meeting that Bancroft, a thirty-seven-year-old carpenter and one of the leading abolitionists in the region, volunteered his barn, and even built a temporary addition to accommodate the expected masses. The barn was outside the jurisdiction of the mayor and village council, which meant that the delegates meeting there were not entitled to the privilege of police protection on their way to the assemblage, during it, or after it. Still, the delegation of so-called fanatics filed through the big double doors and side doors of the barn, one after another, tipping hats, shaking hands, putting faces to names. They came by the dozens, from as far as Cincinnati and Toledo, as close as Alexandria and Columbus. There were now 120 antislavery societies in Ohio, with the largest having a roster of 942 members in the town of Paint Valley, in Ross County, near Cleveland. The total enrollment of the state societies by the spring of 1836 was approximately ten thousand, out of a population of roughly 1.2 million people. </p><p> The list of delegates -- most, if not all, active in the Underground Railroad in their regions -- included: James Birney, the abolitionist editor and close friend of Rankin's who, on January 1, had issued the first edition of his new antislavery newspaper, <i>The Philanthropist,</i> out of New Richmond, Ohio, near Ripley; Rankin; John Isaac Mahan; Dr. Beck; Asa Mahan, formerly a Lane board member and now the president of Oberlin College; twenty-five others from that college and the town of Oberlin, including Lane Rebels Amos Dresser, Augustus Wattles, and James A. Thome; two students from the Granville Literary and Theological Institution who had become notorious for their oratorical speeches against slavery; and nineteen women, some of whom were students from the local women's academy and some delegates from antislavery societies. </p><p> On the first day of the convention, April 27, the delegates crowded the barn, finding space to sit in the hay mows, on high ladders, even on the rafters. More than one hundred spectators entered the barn, carefully watched by men assigned to guard the delegates, standing sentry at the doors of free speech and free assembly. For security, Bancroft placed a big chain across the large gate at the head of the trail leading to the barn from the road; this would require all members of the mob gathering in town to climb the fence, slowing them down and thus preventing a surprise attack on the barn. Others brought dozens of hoop poles from a local cooper's shop. By cutting each one in half, the group had an ample supply of sturdy cudgels, if necessary for self-defense. The poles were piled in a corner of the barn for all to see, and to serve as a reminder that the threat of interruptions and antiabolitionist violence was ever present. </p><p> The day commenced with a resolution from Birney "that in order to perpetuate our free institutions the subject of slavery ought to be fully discussed by the non-slaveholding states." James A. Thome delivered a speech titled "Appeal to the Females of Ohio" in which he beseeched women to stand equally with men in fighting for the rights of the oppressed and to break away from "that odious sentiment" that can shape a woman into nothing more than "a painted puppet or a gilded butterfly." James Dickey, who worked the underground with Rankin out of Greenfield, Ohio, proposed several resolutions, all of which passed. </p><p> The next morning began with the election of officers for the coming year. Alexander Campbell and James Gilliland were voted in as vice presidents; John B. Mahan and John Rankin were appointed the society's managers for Brown County. Birney and two other delegates recommended that $5,000 be raised over the next year, and as $10, $20, and $50 bills passed over heads in the crowd to the platform where Birney stood, a cry for more, for a goal of $10,000, replaced the $5,000 figure. Within minutes, the crowd raised $4,500. After the amount was announced, hundreds of men and women sang until the timbers shook, "Praise God from whom all blessings flow." </p><p> A series of resolutions followed. Then Rankin walked up the three steps to the wooden platform at the center of the barn. A light must have kindled in the depths of his eyes as he looked out onto the throng of hundreds of people united in a cause far larger than themselves. His speech focused on the obligation of the church to take a stand against slavery and began with a denunciation of every Biblical justification for slavery. From Exodus to Deuteronomy to James, he explained, the so-called slaves, which Southern-sympathizers and slaveholders were constantly noting in the Bible, were, in truth, servants. And the difference between slaves and servants was that the natural rights of servants are protected by law, whereas slaves have no such rights to be protected. The servitude in Israel was similar to apprenticeships in America, he said. It was voluntary; the servants were paid for their services; they could be held for no longer than their term of co...</p></p><h2>Art of Drawing: The Complete Course</h2><p>From achieving those first professional strokes to mastering composition, lighting, and color to finishing beautiful still lifes, portraits, and landscapes, here, in one volume, is a course that covers every skill a developing artist needs.

But when planes dropped out of a clear blue sky and bombed the American naval base and aerial targets in Hawaii, all of that changed.&nbsp;<i>December 1941</i>&nbsp;takes readers into the moment-by-moment ordeal of a nation waking to war.</p><p>Best-selling author Craig Shirley celebrates the American spirit while reconstructing the events that called it to shine with rare and piercing light. By turns nostalgic and critical, he puts readers on the ground in the stir and the thick of the action. Relying on daily news reports from around the country and recently declassified government papers, Shirley sheds light on the crucial diplomatic exchanges leading up to the attack, the policies on internment of Japanese living in the U.S. after the assault, and the near-total overhaul of the U.S. economy for war.</p><p>Shirley paints a compelling portrait of pre-war American culture: the fashion, the celebrities, the pastimes. And his portrait of America at war is just as vivid: heroism, self-sacrifice, mass military enlistments, national unity and resolve, and the prodigious talents of Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley aimed at the Axis Powers, as well as the more troubling price-controls and rationing, federal economic takeover, and censorship. &nbsp;</p><p>Featuring colorful personalities such as Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull, and General Douglas MacArthur,&nbsp;<i>December 1941</i>&nbsp;highlights a period of profound change in American government, foreign and domestic policy, law, economics, and business, chronicling the developments day by day through that singular and momentous month.</p><p><i>December 1941</i>&nbsp;features surprising revelations, amusing anecdotes, and heart-wrenching stories, and also explores the unique religious and spiritual dimension of a culture under assault on the eve of Christmas. Before the attack on Pearl Harbor, the closest thing to war for the Americans was uncoordinated, mediocre war games in South Carolina. Less than thirty days later, by the end of December 1941, the nation was involved in a pitched battle for the preservation of its very way of life, a battle that would forever change the nation and the world.</p></p><p>"This book sounds fascinating to me. I am big history buff and I certainly will pick this one up."--<b>Dennis Miller</b>"Offers a rare opportunity to relive that incredible month in a time-travel sort of way, rather than read about it in the hindsight of history.

I read it everywhere, in bathroom, wherever I am. But typically it's written from sort of a distant &nbsp;perspective. You went through newspapers and magazines, and all the accounts of time.

Shirley. . . takes a new tack in his book about Pearl Harbor. Instead of just writing how it all went down, his book attempts to give readers a feel for how the country felt 70 years ago. He accomplishes that by providing anecdotal information from nearly 2,000 newspapers and magazines."--<i>US News &amp; World Report</i>&nbsp;"Craig Shirley, known for creating a you-are-there atmosphere in his earlier books about Ronald Reagan's 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns, has done it again.

Yet few couples actually experience sex as a spiritual, God-ordained experience. Rather than admit their lack of fulfillment, many couples hide their disappointment and confusion, while others attempt to solve the problem through better sexual technique. <br><br>Unfortunately, all the advice on improved technique fails to explain the one thing that makes sense of it all. Despite the proliferation of resources to enhance sexual satisfaction, couples continue to struggle in their sexual relationship. In fact, author and licensed counselor Tim Gardner estimates that as few as 2 percent of married couples ever experience a truly exciting, energizing, and soul-touching physical bond. But now, that can change. <br><br>A couple's sexual relationship has a far higher purpose than pleasure or procreation. Scripture makes it clear that sex is the one thing on earth that joins two people into one. Now readers can learn how to approach marital sex in a way that brings the fulfillment of true oneness. <i>Sacred Sex</i> shows how they can experience a beautiful, God-ordained life of intimacy that blesses them far beyond the bedroom walls, serves as an act of worship to God, and touches their hearts and souls in ways they never could have imagined.</p><p><b>Dr. Tim A. Gardner</b> is a licensed counselor, ordained minister, and director of The Cabin counseling center. He also serves as Director of Family Ministries at Zionsville Presbyterian Church. Tim and his wife, Amy, are the founders and primary speakers for Marriage Makers, a weekend enrichment retreat. They are the parents of three children and live in the Indianapolis area."How can I mention holiness and sex in the same phrase?" asks Tim Gardner, the author of Sacred Sex: A Spiritual Celebration of Oneness in Marriage. "Well, for one thing, because God does." So begins this thoughtful let's-talk-about-sex book for Christians. Gardner encourages readers (i.e., married couples) to practice unconditional acceptance of their partners' bodies and to have a clear understanding of why God created sex in the first place. The "big O," according to Gardner, "is not orgasm; it's oneness." Gardner provides excellent biblical and cultural examples of why the union of husband and wife should, as the New Testament explains it, represent the mystery of the relationship between Christ and the church. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Social History of Tea: Tea's Influence on Commerce, Culture &amp; Community</h2><p><p>British writer and tea historian Jane Pettigrew has joined forces again with American tea writer Bruce Richardson to chronicle the fascinating story of tea&#x2019;s influence on British and American culture, commerce and community spanning nearly four centuries.

The Beatles began recording sessions with three different producers&#x2014;Glyn Johns, George Martin, and Chris Thomas&nbsp;alternating at the helm. After this erratic start to the year, the group decided it was time to get back to where they once belonged. That July, the Beatles returned to Abbey Road, where seven years earlier they had their first recording session with George Martin. The band&nbsp;recaptured the magic and camaraderie that was missing during the January sessions, and the resulting album, <i>Abbey Road</i>, quickly topped the charts in both the UK and the US. Although the group&#x2019;s January 1969 recordings would eventually be issued on <i>Let It Be&nbsp;</i>in May 1970, <i>Abbey Road </i>would be the last album recorded by the Beatles.

Previously in hardback."</p></p><h2>Agent Garbo: The Brilliant, Eccentric Secret Agent Who Tricked Hitler and Saved D-Day</h2><p>&#x201c;The book presses ever forward down a path of historical marvels and astonishing facts. The effect is like a master class that&#x2019;s accessible to anyone, and <i>Agent Garbo</i> often reads as though it were written in a single, perfect draft.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Atlantic</i><br>Before he remade himself as the master spy known as Garbo, Juan Pujol was nothing more than a Barcelona poultry farmer. But as Garbo, he turned in a masterpiece of deception that changed the course of World War II. Posing as the Nazis&#x2019; only reliable spy inside England, he created an imaginary million-man army, invented armadas out of thin air, and brought a vast network of fictional subagents to life. The scheme culminated on June 6, 1944, when Garbo convinced the Germans that the Allied forces approaching Normandy were just a feint&#x2014;the real invasion would come at Calais. Because of his brilliant trickery, the Allies were able to land with much less opposition and eventually push on to Berlin.<br><br>As incredible as it sounds, everything in Agent Garbo is true, based on years of archival research and interviews with Pujol&#x2019;s family. This pulse-pounding thriller set in the shadow world of espionage and deception reveals the shocking reality of spycraft that occurs just below the surface of history.<br>&#x201c;Stephan Talty&#x2019;s unsurpassed research brings forth one of the war&#x2019;s greatest agents in a must-read book for those who think they know all the great World War II stories.&#x201d; &#x2014;Gregory Freeman, author of <i>The Forgotten 500</i></p><p><p>STEPHAN TALTY&nbsp;has contributed reporting to the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>GQ, Details,</i> and many other publications. He is the author of <i>Escape from the Land of Snows, </i>the best-selling <i>Empire of Blue Water, The Illustrious Dead</i>, and <i>Mulatto America</i>.</p><p></p><p><b>Were the D-Day landings saved from failure because of a lone secret agent?</b><br><br><i>Agent Garbo</i> tells the astonishing story of a self-made secret agent who matched wits with the best minds of the Third Reich &#x2014; and won. Juan Pujol was a nobody, a Barcelona poultry farmer determined to oppose the Nazis. Using only his gift for daring falsehoods, Pujol became Germany&#x2019;s most valued agent &#x2014; or double agent: it took four tries before the British believed he was really on the Allies&#x2019; side.<br><br>In the guise of Garbo, Pujol turned in a masterpiece of deception worthy of his big-screen namesake. He created an imaginary million-man army, invented armadas out of thin air, and brought a vast network of fictional subagents whirring to life. His unwitting German handlers believed every word, and banked on Garbo&#x2019;s lies as their only source of espionage within Great Britain.<br><br>For his greatest performance, Pujol had to convince the German High Command that the D-Day invasion of Normandy was a feint and the real attack was aimed at Calais. The Nazis bought it, turning the tide of battle at the crucial moment.<br><br>Based on years of archival research and interviews with Pujol&#x2019;s family, <i>Agent Garbo</i> is a true-life thriller set in the shadow world of espionage and deception.</p></p><h2>All That You&#39;ve Seen Here Is God: New Versions of Four Greek Tragedies Sophocles&#39; Ajax, Philoctetes, Women of Trachis; Aeschylus&#39; Prometheus Bound</h2><p>These contemporary translations of four Greek tragedies speak across time and connect readers and audiences with universal themes of war, trauma, suffering, and betrayal. Under the direction of Bryan Doerries, they have been performed for tens of thousands of combat veterans, as well as prison and medical personnel around the world. Striking for their immediacy and emotional impact,&nbsp;Doerries&nbsp;brings to life these ancient plays, like no other translations have before.</p><p><br>Bryan Doerries is a writer, director, and translator. He is the founder of Theater of War, a project that presents readings of ancient Greek plays to service members, veterans, caregivers, and families to help them initiate conversations about the visible and invisible wounds of war. He is also the cofounder of Outside the Wire, a social impact company that uses theater and a variety of other media to address pressing public health and social issues, such as combat-related psychological injury, end-of-life care, prison reform, domestic violence, political violence, recovery from natural and man-made disasters, substance abuse, and addiction. A self-described evangelist for classical literature and its relevance to our lives today, Doerries uses age-old approaches to help individuals and communities heal from suffering and loss. <br><br>For more information about his work, please visit: www.outsidethewirellc.com.CHARACTERS<br><i>(in order of appearance)<br></i>Odysseus:<i> the director of Greek intelligence<br></i>Ajax: <i>a formidable warrior<br></i>Athena:<i> the goddess of war<br></i>Chorus:<i> the sailors and soldiers of Ajax<br></i>Tecmessa:<i> the battle-won wife of Ajax<br></i>Eurysaces:<i> their three-year-old son<br></i>Messenger:<i> a soldier of the Greek army<br></i>Teucer:<i> the half brother of Ajax<br></i>Menelaus:<i> the deputy commander of the Greek army<br></i>Agamemnon:<i> the commander of the Greek army<br></i>Odysseus<i> appears at dawn&#x2014;low to the ground&#x2014;darting in and out of shadows.

<br><br>Athena&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his mind, their blood was yours. <br> <br>Odysseus&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wished to kill the Greeks? <br><br>Athena&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affirmative.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would have completed his mission&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had I not been paying attention. <br><br>Odysseus&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did he find the courage to do it?

Lower your voice. <br><br>Athena&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch what you say. Someone might call you a coward. <br><br>Odysseus&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please, Athena, by the gods, let him stay inside the tent. <br><br>Athena&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#x2019;s only a man, not to be feared, the same as before. <br><br>Odysseus&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was and is my enemy. <br><br>Athena&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well isn&#x2019;t it satisfying to laugh at an enemy? <br><br>Odysseus&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would please me more if he stayed within. <br><br>Athena&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you afraid to gaze upon a maniac? <br><br>Odysseus&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was sane, I would have met his stare. <br> <br>Athena&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He won&#x2019;t see you standing before him. <br><br>Odysseus&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn&#x2019;t he looking through the same eyes? <br><br>Athena&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#x2019;ll shade his eyes and darken his vision. <br><br>Odysseus&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the goddess wants, she takes. <br><br>Athena&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand there silently. Do not move! <br><br>Odysseus&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must remain, against my wishes.</p><h2>The Lord&#39;s Service: The Grace of Covenant Renewal Worship</h2><p>Evangelicals are generally clueless about worship. When we're not putting guys with long hair and guitars at the front of the church, we are often pursuing the latest high church fad, with incense making up for the smoke on the rock and roll stage.<p></p><p>In this book which began as a practical guide to worship, Jeffrey Meyers charts an alternative. He lays out out a case for a covenant renewal service by means of Old Testament sacrificial liturgics, biblical typology, and covenant theology. He then guides us through the stages of a covenant renewal liturgy, explaining from Scripture the meanings of each step of the service. The final section addresses miscellaneous issues in worship, such as the use of creeds, the "regulative principle," and ministerial clothing.</p><p></p><p>Jeffrey Meyers provides not only a compelling biblical, theological, and historical case for covenant renewal worship, but also shows that it is beautiful, profound, edifying, and liberating.</p></p><p>Jeffrey J. Meyers is a fellow at Theopolis Institute in Birmingham Alabama and pastor of Providence Reformed Presbyterian Church (PCA), St. Louis, Missouri.</p><h2>Abduction: How Liberalism Steals Our Children&#39;s Hearts And Minds</h2><p><p>Sounding the Alarm</p> <p>The authors sound an Amber Alert for the souls of America's youth. They expose how the liberal Left seeks to brainwash our kids for their political gain. Movies, TV, music, court decisions, news reports and the education system are all corrupted by the Left to control the nation's youth. Parents, who seek to protect their children from the devious deception of a liberal agenda, will find this book to be a practical guide to push back against the Liberal efforts designed to reshape our kids' worldview and destroy their moral compass.</p> <p>Steve Feazel and Dr. Carol Swain ring a warning bell for all parents to heed who want their children to embrace and cherish traditional values and moral living that will allow them to live happy and productive lives. The book reveals the dangers of a relative morality while providing practical action steps that parents can take to prevent their children from becoming conformed to the secular pattern of the world.</p> <p> <strong>-Tim Wildmon, President of American Family Association</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>I thank God for Carol Swain. Very few people are willing to see, much less say what she and Steve Feazel say in this tremendously important book. It is disturbing, but it is true, so it is up to us to see it for ourselves and help others to do the same. Please spread the word.</p> <p>-<strong> Eric Metaxas, <em>New York Times</em> Bestselling author of <em>Bonhoeffer</em> and <em>If You Can Keep It: The Forgotten Promise of American Liberty</em></strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Everywhere we turn, from our schools, to Hollywood, to the media to the courts, children's minds and souls are being usurped by the radical secular Left. Carol Swain and Steve Feazel tackle the immoral architects of the "New Morality" in this trenchant and timely book--and show parents how to fight back.</p> <p><strong>-</strong><strong> Michelle Malkin, author of <em>Culture of Corruption </em>and <em>Who Built That</em></strong></p> <p> </p> <p>A national wakeup call sounding the alarm on how sinful forces are undermining timeless spiritual values which are so important to maintain to nurture the success of future generations. This unique book provides positive insight that if applied can push back against a culture that places too little value on morality.</p> <p><strong>-Dr. Alveda King, Civil Rights and Pro-Life Activist, Author, Christian Minister</strong></p></p><p></p><h2>A Rocking Horse Catholic</h2><p>A ROCKING HORSE CATHOLIC<br> CARYLL HOUSELANDER <br><br> Publisher: Available in Kindle E-Book: <br>ISBN-13: 978-1-78379-332-7 <br><br> A Rocking-Horse Catholic is the Autobiography of Caryll Houselander, a modern Catholic laywomen and mystic. <br><br> &#x201c;For me, the greatest joy in being once again in full communion with the Catholic Church has been, and is now, the ever-growing reassurance given by the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ, with its teaching that we are the Church, and that &#x201c;Christ and His Church are one&#x201d;&#x2014;and that because Christ and His Church are one, the world&#x2019;s sorrow, with which I have always been obsessed, and which is a common obsession in these tragic years, is only the shadow cast by the spread arms of the crucified King to shelter us until the morning of resurrection from the blaze of everlasting love.&#x201d; <br><br> PUBLISHER: CATHOLIC WAY PUBLISHING</p><p>For those of the Catholic faith who enjoy reading the Catholic classics and wonderful Catholic books that are hard to find in other places, you&#39;ll find yourself enthusiastic with Catholic Way Publishing, who exist to supply you with these glorious works.

The widest use of the sea, integrated fully into our national strength, is as important to America in the age of nuclear power and space travel as in those stirring days of the birth of the Republic."</i> President John Fitzgerald Kennedy Robert Johns Bulkley (1880 &#x2013; 1965) was a United States Democratic Party politician from Ohio. He served in the United States House of Representatives, and in the United States Senate from 1930 until 1939. A graduate of Harvard University for undergraduate studies and law school, Bulkley commenced the practice of law in Cleveland, Ohio in 1906. Bulkley served two terms in the House from 1911-1915 from the 21st District on Cleveland's East Side. During World War One he served as chief of the legal section of the War Industries Board. He was later elected to the U.S. Senate in 1930 to fill the vacancy created by the death of Theodore E. Burton. Bulkley was re-elected in 1932, but lost a bid for a second full term in 1938 to Robert A. Taft. After his term in the Senate ended, he resumed his practice of law.</p><p></p><h2>Canal House Cooks Every Day</h2><p>From the award-winning authors of the <i>Canal House Cooking</i> series, their first comprehensive collection of recipes by home cooks for home cooks.

This engaging collection of essays, some published here for the first time, reveals Smith as a passionate and precise essayist, equally at home in the world of great books and bad movies, family and philosophy, British comedians and Italian divas. Whether writing on Katherine Hepburn, Kafka, Anna Magnani, or Zora Neale Hurston, she brings deft care to the art of criticism with a style both sympathetic and insightful. <i>Changing My Mind</i> is journalism at its most expansive, intelligent, and funny--a gift to readers and writers both.</p><p><b>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2009</b>: One of Zadie Smith's great gifts as a novelist is her openness: both to character and ideas in her stories, and to what a novel itself should be. That she's a novelist was clear as soon she broke through with <i>White Teeth</i> in her early twenties, but what kind she'll be (or will be next) seems open to change. Which all, along with her consistent intelligence, grace, and wit, makes her an ideal essayist too, especially for the sort of "occasional essays" collected for the first time in <i>Changing My Mind</i>. She can make the case equally for the cozy "middle way" of E.M. Forster and the most purposefully demanding of David Foster Wallace's stories, both as a reader and, you imagine, as a writer who is considering their methods for her own. The occasions in this book didn't only bring her to write about writers, though: she also investigates, among other subjects, Katherine Hepburn, Liberia, and Barack Obama (through the lens of <i>Pygmalion</i>), and, in the collection's finest piece, recalls her late father and their shared comedy snobbery. One wishes more occasions upon her. <i>--Tom Nissley</i><b>Zadie Smith</b>&nbsp;is the author of the novels&nbsp;<i>White Teeth</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Autograph Man</i>,&nbsp;<i>On Beauty</i>,&nbsp;<i>NW</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Swing Time</i>, as well as a novella,&nbsp;<i>The Embassy of Cambodia</i>, and a collection of essays, <i>Feel Free</i>.

But that&#x2019;s what happens when you&#x2019;re a mediator&#x2014;cursed with the &#x201c;gift&#x201d; of communicating with the dead.</p><p>That&#x2019;s how Suze has ended up at the graves of a pair of tragic young lovers. They&#x2019;re NCDPs&#x2014;Non-Compliant Deceased Persons&#x2014;whose drama didn&#x2019;t end with death. It&#x2019;s Suze&#x2019;s job to make sure they move on&#x2014;for good.</p><p>But the NCDPs aren&#x2019;t the only ones with problems. The reason Suze is spending her Valentine&#x2019;s Day with the undead instead of her boyfriend, Jesse, is because he&#x2019;s having so much trouble adjusting to life after death . . . not surprising, considering the fact that he used to be an NCDP himself, and now his girlfriend busts his former kind for a living.</p><p>Can Suze use her mediating skills to propose a mutual resolution, and bring all these young lovers together, especially on the night Saint Valentine declared sacred to romance?

No longer does she have to watch her older sister, Beezus, ride the bus to school with all the big kids. She's finally old enough to do it too!</p><p>Then she gets into trouble for pulling her classmate's <em>boingy</em> curls during recess. Even worse, her crush rejects her in front of everyone. Beezus says Ramona needs to quit being a pest, but how can she stop if she never was <em>trying</em> to be one in the first place?</p></p><p>The engaging tale of young Ramona Quimby's first days in kindergarten, <i>Ramona the Pest</i> takes a pint-sized perspective on the trials and delights of beginning school. Ramona can't wait to learn all the important things. But she's disappointed when her teacher can't fill in missing parts of story lines, such as how Mike Mulligan (of <i>Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel</i>) went to the bathroom while digging the basement of the town hall. Nonetheless, Ramona loves her teacher, and loves going to school in spite of the torments--having to wear hand-me-down boots, for example, or having to (sometimes) suppress the urge to pull on another girl's "boing-boing" curls. Ramona's energetic take on life appeals to children who have passed through this stage, or who are dealing with a kindergarten-age sibling who is exhibiting Ramona-ish tendencies. (Ages 7 to 12) <i>--Richard Farr</i><p>Ramona has been waiting years just to get to kindergarten, and once she's there she wants everyone to know it. She pretends to snore during quiet time to prove what a good rester she is. She yanks on prissy classmate Susan's curls&#x2014;not to be mean, but because their "boinginess" is so tempting. And she gleefully plays the baddest witch on Halloween. </p><p>Big sister Beezus and others call her Ramona the Pest. Perhaps they don't understand that a littler person sometimes has to be "a little bit noisier and a little bit more stubborn in order to be noticed at all." </p><p>Beloved author Beverly Cleary documents Ramona's hilarious&#x2014;and heartwarming&#x2014;struggles to make her way in a perplexing world. With gloriously fresh illustrations by Jacqueline Rogers created for this new edition, <em>Ramona the Pest</em> is the perfect tale for the spirited five-year-old in all of us.</p></p><h2>The High Performance Planner [Yellow]</h2><p><b>Now in yellow!

Fueling this exchange was West African gold, prized for its purity and used for minting currencies and adorning luxury objects such as jewelry, textiles, and religious objects. Caravans made the arduous journey by camel southward across the Sahara carrying goods for trade&#x2015;glass vessels and beads, glazed ceramics, copper, books, and foodstuffs, including salt, which was obtained in the middle of the desert. Northward, the journey brought not only gold but also ivory, animal hides and leatherwork, spices, and captives from West Africa forced into slavery.</p><p><i>Caravans of Gold, Fragments in Time</i> draws on the latest archaeological discoveries and art historical research to construct a compelling look at medieval trans-Saharan exchange and its legacy. Contributors from diverse disciplines present case studies that form a rich portrayal of a distant time. Topics include descriptions of key medieval cities around the Sahara; networks of exchange that contributed to the circulation of gold, copper, and ivory and their associated art forms; and medieval glass bead production in West Africa&#x2019;s forest region. The volume also reflects on Morocco&#x2019;s Gnawa material culture, associated with descendants of West African slaves, and movements of people across the Sahara today.</p><p>Featuring a wealth of color images, this fascinating book demonstrates how the rootedness of place, culture, and tradition is closely tied to the circulation of people, objects, and ideas. These &#x201c;fragments in time&#x201d; offer irrefutable evidence of the key role that Africa played in medieval history and promote a new understanding of the past and the present.</p><p>Published in association with the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, Northwestern University</p><p><b>Exhibition Schedule</b><br>Block Museum of Art, Northwestern University<br>January 26&#x2013;July 21, 2019</p><p>Aga Khan Museum, Toronto<br>September 21, 2019&#x2013;February 23, 2020</p><p>Smithsonian National Museum of African Art, Washington, DC<br>April 8&#x2013;November 29, 2020</p></p><p><b>Kathleen Bickford Berzock</b> is associate director of curatorial affairs at the Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University.

Grant</h2><p>Completed just days before his death and hailed by Mark Twain as &#34;the most remarkable work of its kind since the Commentaries of Julius Caesar,&#34; this is the now-legendary autobiography of ULYSSES SIMPSON GRANT (1822-1885), 18th president of the United States and the Union general who led the North to victory in the Civil War. Though Grant opens with tales of his boyhood, his education at West Point, and his early military career in the Mexican-American war of the 1840s, it is Grant&#39;s intimate observations on the conduct of the Civil War, which make up the bulk of the work, that have made this required reading for history students, military strategists, and Civil War buffs alike. This unabridged edition features all the material that was originally published in two volumes in 1885 and 1886, including maps, illustrations, and the text of Grant&#39;s July 1865 report to Washington on the state of the armies under his command.</p><p>In 1862, a prominent Republican visited President Lincoln and called General Ulysses S. Grant an incompetent drunk who created unnecessary political problems. Lincoln, frustrated with all his generals but this one, famously replied: "I can't spare this man; he fights." Indeed, Lincoln had gone through a series of unheroic generals before settling on Grant to lead the Union's Army of the Potomac. Grant's success at marshaling the industrial might of the North eventually pounded the South into submission. This memoir, finished as its author was dying of throat cancer in 1885, is widely admired for its clear and straightforward prose. The volume was an enormously popular hit upon publication (by Mark Twain, no less), and today <i>Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant</i> ranks among the finest pieces of military autobiography ever written.These are in stock and ready for immediate shipment if you use the DSI4 Marketplace shop.

An athletic prodigy, Pete resolved from his earliest playing days never to let anything get in the way of his love for the game. But while this determination led to tennis domination, success didn&#x2019;t come without a price. <br><br>Here for the first time Pete speaks freely about the personal trials he faced&#x2014;including the death of a longtime coach and confidant&#x2014;and the struggles he gutted his way through while being seemingly on top of the world. Among the book&#x2019;s most riveting scenes are the devastating early loss that led Pete to make a monastic commitment to the game; fierce on-court battles with Andre Agassi; and the triumphant last match of Pete&#x2019;s career at the finals of the 2002 U.S. Open.<br><br>"A thoroughly compelling read that really probes the hard drive of a champion...All the emotion and insight that Sampras seemes reluctant to express during his playing days come spilling forth." &#x2014;Jon Wertheim, senior writer, <i>Sports Illustrated</i></p><p>PETE SAMPRAS holds the distinction of being the youngest male player to win the U.S. Open. During his career he won sixty-four top-level singles titles (including fourteen Grand Slams, eleven ATP Masters Series titles, and five Tennis Masters Cup titles).Handsome and talented tennis champion Pete Sampras always preferred to let his racket do the talking. His memoir finally allows tennis fans into the life of this elite athlete. Written in a strictly chronological order, the material includes some stories that belie the calm that Sampras always tried to show on the court. His first meetings with his wife are rather humorous. The descriptions of his matches against Andre Agassi remain as compelling to hear as they were to watch. Narrator Mark Deakins delivers a straightforward narration with no vocal characterizations and tightly controlled energy. Listeners may get the feeling this audio presentation is exactly like watching a Pete Sampras tennis match: perfectly executed, occasionally exciting, sometimes interesting, but rather unemotional.

Cat Conrad.<b>1 </b><p></p><p>On the day Claire became a member of the Glass House, somebody stole her laundry. </p><p>When she reached into the crappy, beat-up washing machine, she found nothing but the wet slick sides of the drum, and&#x2014;like a bad joke&#x2014;the worst pair of underwear she owned, plus one sock. She was in a hurry, of course&#x2014;there were only a couple of machines on this top floor of Howard Hall, the least valued and most run-down rooms in the least valued, most run-down dorm. Two washing machines, two dryers, and you were lucky if one of them was working on any given day and didn't eat your quarters. Forget about the dollar-bill slot. She'd never seen it work, not in the last six weeks since she'd arrived at school. </p><p>"No," she said out loud, and balanced herself on the edge of the washer to look down into the dark, partly rusted interior. It smelled like mold and cheap detergent. Getting a closer look didn't help. </p><p>One crappy pair of underwear, fraying at the seams. One sock.</p><p>She was missing every piece of clothing that she'd worn in the last two weeks. Every piece that she actually <i>wanted </i> to wear.</p><p>"No!" She yelled it into the washer, where it echoed back at her, and slumped back down, then kicked the washer violently in the dent made by all the other disappointed students before her. She couldn't breathe. She had some other clothes&#x2014;a few&#x2014;but they were <i>last-choice</i> clothes, oh-my-God-wouldn't-be-caught-dead clothes. Pants that were too short and made her look like a hick, shirts that were too big and too stupid, and made her look like her mom had picked them out. And she had.</p><p>Claire had about three hundred dollars left to last her for, well, months, after the latest round of calling out for pizza and buying yet <i>another </i> book for Professor Clueless Euliss, who didn't seem to have figured out yet what subject he was teaching. </p><p>She supposed she could find some clothes, if she looked around, that wouldn't totally blow her entire budget. After all, downtown Morganville, Texas, was the thrift shop capital of the world. Assuming she could find <i>anything </i> she could stand to wear.</p><p><i>Mom said this would happen</i>, she thought. <i>I just have to think. Keep my cool. </i> </p><p>Claire threw herself into an orange plastic chair, dumped her backpack on the scratched linoleum, and put her head in her hands. Her face felt hot, and she was shaking, and she knew, just knew, that she was going to cry. Cry like the baby they all said she was, too young to be here, too young to be away from Mommy. It sucked to be smart, because this was where it got you. </p><p>She gulped deep, damp breaths and sat back, willing herself not to bawl (because they'd hear), and wondered if she could call Mom and Dad for an extension on her allowance, or use the credit card that was "just for emergencies." </p><p>Then she saw the note. Not so much "note" as graffiti, but it was addressed to her, on the painted cinder-block wall above the machines.</p><p><i>DEAR DORK</i>, it read, <i>WE FOUND TRASH IN THE MACHINES AND THREW IT DOWN THE CHUTE. IF YOU WANT IT, DIVE FOR IT. </i> </p><p>"Shit," she breathed, and had to blink back tears again, for an entirely different reason. Blind, stupid rage. <i>Monica</i>. Well, Monica and the Monickettes, anyway. Why was it the hot mean girls always ran in packs, like hyenas? And why, with all the shimmery hair and long tanned legs and more of Daddy's money than Daddy's accountants, did they have to focus on <i>her</i>?</p><p>No, she knew the answer to that. </p><p>She'd made Monica look stupid in front of her friends, and some hot upperclassmen. Not that it had been all that hard; she'd just been walking by, heard Monica saying that World War II had been "that dumbass Chinese war thing." </p><p>And by simple reflex, she'd said, "It wasn't." The whole lot of them, slouched all over the couches in the dorm lobby, looked at her with as much blank surprise as if the Coke machine had just spoken up. Monica, her friends, three of the cool older frat boys.</p><p>"World War II," Claire had plunged on, panicked and not quite sure how to get out of what she'd gotten herself into. "I just meant&#x2014;well, it wasn't the Korean War. That was later. World War II was with the Germans and the Japanese. You know, Pearl Harbor?" </p><p>And the guys had looked at Monica and laughed, and Monica had flushed&#x2014;not much, but enough to ruin the cool perfection of her makeup. "Remind me not to buy any history papers off of you," the cutest of the guys had said. "What kind of dumbass doesn't know that?" Though Claire had been sure none of them had, really. "Chinese. Riiiiight."</p><p>Claire had seen the fury in Monica's eyes, quickly covered over with smiles and laughter and flirting. Claire had ceased to exist again, for the guys.</p><p>For the girls, she was brand-new, and unwelcome as hell. She'd been dealing with it all her life. Smart and small and average-looking wasn't exactly winning the life lottery; you had to fight for it, whatever it was. Somebody was always laughing at, or hitting, or ignoring you, or a combination of the first two. She'd thought when she was a kid that getting laughed at was the worst thing, and then&#x2014;after the first couple of school-yard showdowns&#x2014;getting hit jumped up to number one. But for most of her (brief, two-year) high school experience, being ignored was worse by far. She'd gotten there a year earlier than everybody else, and left a year ahead of them. Nobody liked that. </p><p>Nobody but teachers, anyway. </p><p>The problem was that Claire really loved school. Loved books, and reading, and learning things&#x2014;okay, not calculus, but pretty much everything else. Physics. What normal girl loved <i>physics</i>? Abnormal ones. Ones who were not ever going to be hot.</p><p>And face it, being hot? That was what life was all about. As Monica had proved, when the world had wobbled off its axis for a few seconds to notice Claire, and then wobbled right back to revolve around the pretty ones. </p><p>It wasn't fair. She'd dived in and worked her ass off through high school. Graduated with a perfect 4.0, scored high enough on the tests to qualify for admission to the great schools, the legendary schools, the ones where being a brainiac mutant girl-freak wasn't necessarily a downside. (Except that, of course, at those schools, there were probably <i>hot tall leggy</i> brainiac mutant girl-freaks.)</p><p>Didn't matter. Mom and Dad had taken one look at the stack of enthusiastic thumbs-up replies from universities like MIT and Caltech and Yale, and clamped down hard. No way was their sixteen-year-old daughter (nearly seventeen, she kept insisting, although it wasn't really true) going to run off three thousand miles to go to school. At least not at first. (Claire had tried, unsuccessfully, to get across the concept that if anything would kill her budding academic career worse than being a transfer student at one of those places, it was being a transfer student from <i>Texas Prairie University</i>. Otherwise known as TPEwwwwwww.) </p><p>So here she was, stuck on the crappy top floor of a crappy dorm in a crappy school where eighty percent of the students transferred after the first two years&#x2014;or dropped out&#x2014;and the Monickettes were stealing her wet laundry and dumping it down the trash chute, all because Monica couldn't be bothered to know anything about one of the world wars big enough to rate a Roman numeral. </p><p><i>But it isn't fair! </i> something in her howled. <i>I had a plan! An actual plan! </i> Monica slept late, and Claire had gotten up early just to do laundry while all the party crowd was comatose and the studious crowd was off to classes. She'd thought she could leave it for a couple of minutes to grab her shower&#x2014;another scary experience&#x2014;and she'd never even thought about anybody doing something so incredibly low.</p><p>As she bit back her sobs, she noticed&#x2014;again&#x2014;how quiet it was up here. Creepy and deserted, with half the girls deep asleep and the other half gone. Even when it was crowded and buzzing, the dorm was creepy, though. Old, decrepit, full of shadows and corners and places mean girls could lurk. In fact, that summed up the whole town. Morganville was small and old and dusty, full of creepy little oddities. Like the fact that the streetlights worked only half the time, and they were too far apart when they did. Like the way the people in the local campus stores seemed <i>too </i> happy. Desperately happy. Like the fact that the whole town, despite the dust, was <i>clean</i>&#x2014;no trash, no graffiti, nobody begging for spare change in alleyways. </p><p>Weird. </p><p>She could almost hear her mother saying, <i>Honey, it's just that you're in a strange place. It'll get better. You'll just have to try harder. </i></p><i><p></p></i><p></p><p>Mom always said things like that, and Claire had always done her best to hide how hard it was to follow that advice. </p><p>Well. Nothing to do but try to get her stuff back. </p><p>Claire gulped a couple more times, wiped her eyes, and hauled the arm-twisting weight of her backpack up and over her shoulder. She stared for a few seconds at the wet pair of panties and one sock clutched in her right hand, then hastily unzipped the front pocket of the backpack and stuffed them in. Man, that would kill whatever cool she had left, if she walked around carrying those. </p><p>"Well," said a low, satisfied voice from the open door opposite the stairs, "look who it is. The Dumpster diver."</p><p>Claire stopped, one hand on the rusted iron railing. Something was telling her to run, but something always told her that: fight-or-flight&#x2014;she'd read the textbooks. And she was tired of flighting. She turned around slowly, as Monica Morrell stepped out of the dorm room&#x2014;not hers, so she'd busted Erica's lock again. Monica's running buddies Jennifer and Gina filed out and took up flanking positions. Soldiers in flip-flops and low-rise jeans and French manicures. </p><p>Monica struck a pose. It was something she was good at, Claire had to admit. Nearly six feet tall, Monica had flowing, shiny black hair, and big blue eyes accented with just the right amount of liner and mascara. Perfect skin. One of those model-shaped faces, all cheekbones and pouty lips. And if she had a model's body, it was a Victoria's Secret model, all curves, not angles. </p><p>She was rich, she was pretty, and as far as Claire could tell, it didn't make her a bit happy. What did, though&#x2014;what made those big blue eyes glow right now&#x2014;was the idea of tormenting Claire just a little more. </p><p>"Shouldn't you be in first period at the junior high by now?" Monica asked. "Or at least <i>getting </i> your first period?"</p><p>"Maybe she's looking for the clothes she left lying around," Gina piled on, and laughed. Jennifer laughed with her. Claire swore their eyes, their pretty jewel-colored eyes, just glowed with the joy of making her feel like shit. "Litterbug!" </p><p>"Clothes?" Monica folded her arms and pretended to think. "You mean, like those rags we threw away? The ones she left cluttering up the washer?"</p><p>"Yeah, those." </p><p>"I wouldn't wear those to sweat in." </p><p>"I wouldn't wear them to scrub out the boys' toilet," Jennifer blurted. </p><p>Monica, annoyed, turned and shoved her. "Yeah, you know all about the boys' toilet, don't you? Didn't you do Steve Gillespie in ninth grade in there?" She made sucking sounds, and they all laughed again, though Jennifer looked uncomfortable. Claire felt her cheeks flare red, even though it wasn't&#x2014;for a change&#x2014;a dis against her. "Jeez, Jen, Steve Gillespie? Keep your mouth shut if you can't think of something that won't embarrass yourself." </p><p>Jennifer&#x2014;of course&#x2014;turned her anger on a safer target. Claire. She lunged forward and shoved Claire back a step, toward the stairs. "Go get your stupid clothes already! I'm sick of looking at you, with your pasty skin&#x2014;" </p><p>"Yeah, Junior High, ever heard of sunshine?" Gina rolled her eyes. </p><p>"Watch it," Monica snapped, which was odd, because all three of them had the best tans money could buy. </p><p>Claire scrambled to steady herself. The heavy backpack pulled her off-balance, and she grabbed on to the banister. Jen lunged at her again and slammed the heel of her hand painfully hard into Claire's collarbone. "Don't!" Claire yelped, and batted Jen's hand away. Hard. </p><p>There was a second of breathless silence, and then Monica said, very quietly, "Did you just hit my friend, you stupid little bitch? Where do you think you get off, doing things like that around here?" </p><p>And she stepped forward and slapped Claire across the face, hard enough to draw blood, hard enough to make flares and comets streak across Claire's vision, hard enough to make everything turn red and boiling hot. </p><p>Claire let go of the banister and slapped Monica right back, full across her pouty mouth, and for just a tight, white-hot second she actually felt <i>good </i> about it, but then Monica hissed like a scorched cat, and Claire had time to think, <i>Oh crap, I really shouldn't have done that. </i></p><i><p></p></i><p></p><p>She never saw the punch coming. Didn't even really feel the impact, except as a blank sensation and confusion, but then the weight of her backpack on her shoulder was pulling her to one side and she staggered. </p><p>She almost caught herself, and then Gina, grinning spitefully, reached over and shoved her backward, down the stairs, and there was nothing but air behind her. </p><p>She hit the edge of every stair, all the way to the bottom. Her backpack broke open and spilled books as she tumbled, and at the top of the stairs Monica and the Monickettes laughed and hooted and high-fived, but she saw it only in disconnected little jerks of motion, freeze-frames. </p><p>It seemed to take forever before she skidded to a stop at the bottom, and then her head hit the wall with a nasty, meaty sound, and everything went black. </p><p>She later remembered only one more thing, in the darkness: Monica's voice, a low and vicious whisper. "Tonight. You'll get what's coming to you, you freak. I'm going to make sure." </p><p>It seemed like seconds, but when she woke up again there was somebody kneeling next to her, and it wasn't Monica or her nail-polish mafia; it was Erica, who had the room at the top of the stairs, four doors down from Claire's. Erica looked pale and strained and scared, and Claire tried to smile, because that was what you did when somebody was scared. She didn't hurt until she moved, and then her head started to throb. There was a red-hot ache near the top, and when she reached up to touch it she felt a hard raised knot. No blood, though. It hurt worse when she probed the spot, but not in an oh-my-God-skull-fracture kind of way, or at least that was what she hoped. </p><p>"Are you okay?" Erica asked, waving her hands kind of helplessly in midair as Claire wiggled her way up to a sitting position against the wall. Claire risked a quick look past her up the stairs, then down. The coast looked Monica-clear. Nobody else had come out to see what was up, either&#x2014;most of them were afraid of getting in trouble, and the rest just flat didn't care. </p><p>"Yeah," she said, and managed a shaky laugh. "Guess I tripped." </p><p>"You need to go to the quack shack?" Which was college code for the university clinic. "Or, God, an ambulance or whatever?" </p><p>"No. No, I'm...</p></p><h2>The Journey of Little Charlie (National Book Award Finalist)</h2><p><b>Newbery Medalist Christopher Paul Curtis brings his trademark humor and heart to the story of a boy struggling to do right in the face of history's cruelest evils.</b><br><br><b>The National Book Award finalist by Christopher Paul Curtis!</b><br><br>Twelve-year-old Charlie is down on his luck: His sharecropper father just died and Cap'n Buck -- the most fearsome man in Possum Moan, South Carolina -- has come to collect a debt.

For the second edition Alasdair MacIntyre has included a new preface in which he examines his book &#x201c;thirty years on&#x201d; and considers its impact. It remains an important work, ideal for all students interested in ethics and morality.</p><p>The author writes...&#39;This history of moral philosophy which runs from the Greeks to contemporary Anglo-Saxon discussion is necessarily compressed and selective, but is intended to enable the general reader and the student to place particular texts in moral philosophy in an historical perspective. The function of this perspective is to clarify three kinds of historical and philosophical connection whose importance is often underrated. The first is a matter of the debts which moral philosophers owe to their predecessors; the second concerns the question of the nature of the moral concepts which furnish any moral philosopher with the objects of his enquiry upon moral concepts themselves and the extent to which the philosophical analysis of a concept may play a part in transforming or even discrediting it. A consequence of these preoccupations is that the book contains a higher proportion of purely philosophical enquiry than might be expected in an historical work.&#39;Alasdair MacIntyre is research professor of philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. He is the author of numerous books, including After <i>Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory</i>, third edition (2007), and <i>Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry: Encyclopaedia, Genealogy, and Tradition</i> (1990), both published by the University of Notre Dame Press.</p><h2>Named by God Bible Study: Overcoming your past, transforming your present, embracing your future</h2><p>You&#x2019;ve read the book; now do the study!

The substantial introduction to the book covers both early pilgrimage as a whole, especially travel by women, and the many liturgical rites of Jerusalem that Egeria describes.

The grave is at Manzanar, where thousands of Americans of Japanese heritage were interned during World War II. Among those rounded up and taken to the internment camp were Laura&#39;s father, then a small boy, and his parents. Now Laura says goodbye to Grandfather in her own special way, with a gesture that crosses generational lines and bears witness to the patriotism that survived a shameful episode in America&#39;s history. Eve Bunting&#39;s poignant text and Chris K. Soentpiet&#39;s detailed, evocative paintings make the story of this family&#39;s visit to Manzanar, and of the memories stirred by the experience, one that will linger in readers&#39; minds and hearts. Afterword.</p><p><p>Eve Bunting has written&nbsp;over two hundred&nbsp;books for children, including the Caldecott Medal-winning <i>Smoky Night,</i> illustrated by David Diaz, <i>The Wall</i>,<i> Fly Away Home</i>, and <i>Train to Somewhere</i>. She lives in Southern California.</p><br><br>Chris K. Soentpiet is an award-winning illustrator whose work reflects his interest in people, history, and culture. He was given the gold medal from the Society of Illustrators in New York City for his illustrations in <i>Haemi Balgassi's Peacebound Trains</i>, and his books have been recognized by the American Booksellers Association, School Library Journal, the International Reading Association, the Junior Library Guild, <i>Parents' Choice</i>, <i>Parents</i>' magazine, and <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine. Soentpiet has a B.F.A. from Pratt Institute.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Grade 2-5AAll the more moving in its restraint, this picture-book account of a fictional family reveals, with gentle dignity, a sad chapter in American history. Laura Iwasaki and her Japanese-American family will soon move from California to Boston, so they are making one last visit to Laura's grandfather's grave, which lies near the Sierra Nevada Mountains, so far from the sea he loved. Before World War II, he was a fisherman. Then, along with Laura's father, her grandmother, and 10,000 other Japanese Americans, he was sent to the Manzanar War Relocation Center. There he died, and his grave is marked with only a ring of stones. The family leaves silk flowers, but Laura leaves her own special memento. Soentpiet's impressionistic watercolors perfectly complement Bunting's evocative text. Both create a palpable sense of Manzanar as it is today: a windy, isolated place, its buildings gone, dominated by snow-covered mountains. Black-and-white paintings that suggest '40s photographs illustrate Laura's father's memories of the camp. This book is much more personal than Sheila Hamanaka's nonfiction text for her mural, The Journey (Orchard, 1990), and more accessible. At the story's end, Laura whispers, "It was wrong." Her father answers, "Sometimes in the end there is no right or wrong....It is just a thing that happened long years ago. A thing that cannot be changed." Yet art and text invite a new generation of Americans to remember that things can go terribly wrong when fear and hysteria prevail.AMargaret A.

Defying all known accepted military practice&#x2014;and indeed, the laws of physics&#x2014;they believed that a soldier could adopt a cloak of invisibility, pass cleanly through walls, and, perhaps most chillingly, kill goats just by staring at them.<br> <br>Entrusted with defending America from all known adversaries, they were the First Earth Battalion. And they really weren't joking. What's more, they're back and fighting the War on Terror.<br> <br>With firsthand access to the leading players in the story, Ronson traces the evolution of these bizarre activities over the past three decades and shows how they are alive today within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and in postwar Iraq. Why are they blasting Iraqi prisoners of war with the theme tune to Barney the Purple Dinosaur? Why have 100 debleated goats been secretly placed inside the Special Forces Command Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina? How was the U.S. military associated with the mysterious mass suicide of a strange cult from San Diego? <i>The Men Who Stare at Goats</i> answers these and many more questions.</p><p>Just when you thought every possible conspiracy theory had been exhausted by <i>The X-Files</i> or <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, along comes <i>The Men Who Stare at Goats</i>. The first line of the book is, "This is a true story." True or not, it is quite astonishing. Author Jon Ronson writes a column about family life for London's <i>Guardian</i> newspaper and has made several acclaimed documentaries. <i>The Men Who Stare at Goats</i> is his bizarre quest into "the most whacked-out corners of George W. Bush's War on Terror," as he puts it. Ronson is inspired when a man who claims to be a former U.S. military psychic spy tells the journalist he has been reactivated following the 9-11 attack. Ronson decides to investigate. His research leads him to the U.S. Army's strange forays into extra-sensory perception and telepathy, which apparently included efforts to kill barnyard animals with nothing more than thought. Ronson meets one ex-Army employee who claims to have killed a goat and his pet hamster by staring at them for prolonged periods of time. Like Ronson's original source, this man also says he has been reactivated for deployment to the Middle East. <p> Ronson's finely written book strikes a perfect balance between curiosity, incredulity, and humor. His characters are each more bizarre than the last, and Ronson does a wonderful job of depicting the colorful quirks they reveal in their often-comical meetings. Through a charming guile, he manages to elicit many strange and amazing revelations. Ronson meets a general who is frustrated in his frequent attempts to walk through walls. One source says the U.S. military has deployed psychic assassins to the Middle East to hunt down Al Qaeda suspects.

They planned and acted to keep the country out of war&#x2014;by stealth and &#x201c;political action&#x201d; and to do by cunning and sleight of hand what great armies could not, must not be allowed to do. In the end, they were too idealistic and too honorable, and were unsuited for the dark, duplicitous life of spying. Their hubris and na�vet� led them astray, producing both sensational coups and spectacular blunders like the Bay of Pigs and the failed assassination attempts on foreign leaders in the early 1960s.

Part two brings the battle into recent times, where the Illuminati&#39;s Agenda 21 is quietly unfolding in an insidious creep towards global fascism and their long-awaited goal of a New World Secular Order, which threatens to strip us of our humanity, replace us with machines, and destroy all Creation.</p><p>My fifth book plunges further down the rabbit hole and identifies technology as a tool of enslavement being promoted by fundamentalist Luciferian Freemasons.<b>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><b>CHAPTER 1</b>LEAVING THE GARDEN OF EDEN&nbsp;<b>PART I</b>THE LUCIFERIAN PERPETRATORS&nbsp;<b>CHAPTER 2</b>THE ROTHSCHILD ILLUMINATI<b>CHAPTER 3</b>PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION&nbsp;<b>CHAPTER 4</b>DIRTY MONEY &amp; THE ANUNNAKI<b>CHAPTER 5</b>THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE<b>CHAPTER 6</b>THE CITY OF LONDON&nbsp;<b>CHAPTER 7</b>THE SOCIAL DARWINISM FRAUD&nbsp;<b>CHAPTER 8</b>PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE FOR ALL&nbsp;<b>PART II</b>THE LUCIFERIAN AGENDA<b>CHAPTER 9</b>AGENDA 21&nbsp;<b>CHAPTER 10</b>THE ILLUMINATI DEPOPULATION AGENDA<b>CHAPTER 11</b>TOXIC FOOD FOR THE MASSES&nbsp;<b>CHAPTER 12</b>POISONING THE ELIXIR<b>CHAPTER 13</b>THE MEDICAL DEATH INDUSTRY<b>CHAPTER 14</b>CASTING THE WORLDWIDE INTER-NET<b>CHAPTER 15</b>2016 ILLUMINATI ELECTION NIGHTMARE<b>CHAPTER 16</b>INTERNET PSYOP AND THE COMING COLLAPSE<b>CHAPTER 17</b>SMART PHONES MAKE DUMB PEOPLE<b>CHAPTER 18</b>CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA FACEBOOK MI6 PSYOP<b>CHAPTER 19</b>TECH ADDICTION &amp; THE ILLUMINATI AGENDA<b>CHAPTER 20</b>THE 5G END GAME<b>CHAPTER 21</b>RETURNING TO THE GARDEN OF EDEN</p><h2>How Reading Changed My Life</h2><p>THE LIBRARY OF CONTEMPORARY THOUGHT is a groundbreaking series where America&#39;s finest writers and most brilliant minds tackle today&#39;s most provocative, fascinating, and relevant issues. Striking and daring, creative and important, these original voices on matters political, social, economic, and cultural, will enlighten, comfort, entertain, enrage, and ignite healthy debate across the country.</p><p>A recurring theme throughout Anna Quindlen's <i>How Reading Changed My Life</i> is the comforting premise that readers are never alone. "There was waking, and there was sleeping. And then there were books," she writes, "a kind of parallel universe in which anything might happen and frequently did, a universe in which I might be a newcomer but never really a stranger. My real, true world." Later, she quotes editor Hazel Rochman: "Reading makes immigrants of us all. It takes us away from home, but, most important, it finds homes for us everywhere." Indeed, Quindlen's essays are full of the names of "friends," real or fictional--Anne of Green Gables and Heidi; Anthony Trollope and Jane Austen, to name just a few--who have comforted, inspired, educated, and delighted her throughout her life. In four short essays Quindlen shares her thoughts on the act of reading itself ("It is like the rubbing of two sticks together to make a fire, the act of reading, an improbable pedestrian task that leads to heat and light"); analyzes the difference between how men and women read ("there are very few books in which male characters, much less boys, are portrayed as devoted readers"); and cheerfully defends middlebrow literature: <blockquote> Most of those so-called middlebrow readers would have readily admitted that the <i>Iliad</i> set a standard that could not be matched by <i>What Makes Sammy Run?</i> or <i>Exodus</i>. But any reader with common sense would also understand intuitively, immediately, that such comparisons are false, that the uses of reading are vast and variegated and that some of them are not addressed by Homer. </blockquote> The Canon, censorship, and the future of publishing, not to mention that of reading itself, are all subjects Quindlen addresses with intelligence and optimism in a book that may not change your life, but will no doubt remind you of other books that did. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Anna Quindlen is the author of two bestselling novels, Object Lessons and One True Thing.

But many laws feature ambiguous or even contradictory wording. How, then, should judges divine their meaning? Should they stick only to the text? To what degree, if any, should they consult aids beyond the statutes themselves? Are the purposes of lawmakers in writing law relevant?<br><br>Some judges, such as Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, believe courts should look to the language of the statute and virtually nothing else. Chief Judge Robert A. Katzmann of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit respectfully disagrees. In Judging Statutes, Katzmann, who is a trained political scientist as well as a judge, argues that our constitutional system charges Congress with enacting laws; therefore, how Congress makes its purposes known through both the laws themselves and reliable accompanying materials should be respected. He looks at how the American government works, including how laws come to be and how various agencies construe legislation. He then explains the judicial process of interpreting and applying these laws through the demonstration of two interpretative approaches, purposivism (focusing on the purpose of a law) and textualism (focusing solely on the text of the written law). Katzmann draws from his experience to show how this process plays out in the real world, and concludes with some suggestions to promote understanding between the courts and Congress.<br><br>When courts interpret the laws of Congress, they should be mindful of how Congress actually functions, how lawmakers signal the meaning of statutes, and what those legislators expect of courts construing their laws. The legislative record behind a law is in truth part of its foundation, and therefore merits consideration.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert A. Katzmann </strong>is Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The only jurist in the federal courts with a Ph.D in political science, throughout his career he has been concerned about how to make government function more effectively. At the time of his appointment to the federal bench, he was the Walsh Professor of Government, Professor of Law and Professor of Public Policy at Georgetown University; a fellow of the Brookings Institution; and president of the Governance Institute. Numerous awards for his public service, as well as his legal writing, have been bestowed on Judge Katzmann since joining the bench.<br><br>"read this book, read this book" -<em>Harvard Law Review</em><p></p><br>"Robert Katzmann has written an illuminating and convincing book about the importance of ascertaining the actual intent of the legislators who draft and enact our statutes. It should be required reading for all lawyers confronting questions of statutory construction when advising clients or arguing such issues before judges." <br>-Justice John Paul Stevens (Ret.) <br><p></p><br>"Judge Katzmann is a dedicated public servant and a highly regarded judge. This compelling book is a welcome addition to the increasingly urgent conversation about how courts interpret what we do as members of Congress." <br>-Senator Charles E. Schumer <br><p></p><br>"Beautifully crafted, sensitive to the contrasting workways of Congress, executive agencies, and courts, and wise in its conclusions on this contested arena of judging, this book will quickly become the essential primer for judges, legislators, and citizens who aspire to more effective government. Katzmann, the first and only political scientist appointed to the federal bench, draws on his extraordinary knowledge and experience as a judge, scholar, law professor and interlocutor between the branches to produce this splendid brief treatise on statutory interpretation." <br>-Thomas E. Mann, W. Averell Harriman Chair &amp; Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution <br><p></p><br>"The most erudite book any American judge has ever published on statutory interpretation, combining common sense with masterful scholarship.

The second edition of this classic text features revisions by the author that improve its user-friendly qualities, and an introductory survey of latter-day developments in classic superconductivity enhances the volume&#x2019;s value as a reference for researchers. Starting with a historical overview, the text proceeds with an introduction to the electrodynamics of superconductors and presents expositions of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Additional subjects include magnetic properties of classic type II superconductors; the Josephson effect (both in terms of basic phenomena and applications and of the phenomena unique to small junctions); fluctuation effects in classic superconductors; the high-temperature superconductors; special topics (such as the Bogoliubov method, magnetic perturbations and gapless superconductivity, and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory); and nonequilibrium superconductivity. 1996 edition.</p><p></p></p><p>Using the simplest and most physically intuitive arguments and methods, Introduction to Superconductivity exposes not only graduate students but professionals in academe and industry to the breadth and richness of the phenomenon of superconductivity. Applications as well as fundamental principles are thoroughly covered. The author not only views superconductivity as a macroscopic quantum state, as described by the Ginzburg-Landau phenomenological equation, but also recognizes that the fundamental entity is the paired electrons of the microscopic theory of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer. Special features include a treatment of varied phenomena in a simple way which keeps the microscopic theory of BCS in the background, and a thorough discussion of magnetic properties of type II superconductors, including dissipative effects and the use of twisted multifilamentary wires. After treating the fundamentals of the Josephson effects, an analysis is given of how the popular RF-biased SQUID magnetometer works. An extensive discussion of fluctuation effects is also included. Major changes in this new edition include the following: new chapter on high temperature superconductors; updated and expanded discussion of the Josephson effect; new chapter on the Josephson effect in mesoscopic junctions; new chapter on nonequilibrium superconductivity; introductory treatment of electrodynamics in London theory level; and the deemphasis of nonlocal electrodynamics. The level of treatment presumes a background in Solid State Physics and Basic Quantum Mechanics and avoids the use of Thermal Green&#39;s Functions.Michael Tinkham is now the Rumford Professor of Physics and Gordon McKay Professor of Applied Physics.</p><h2>Veterinary Medical Terminology Guide and Workbook</h2><p><p>Designed to be both comprehensive and user-friendly, the text offers easy-to-understand explanations of medical terminology and contains helpful learning features such as tips, case studies, and review questions.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Describes medical terms with easy-to-understand explanations and phonetic spellings</li> <li>Offers an updated edition of this practical guide to veterinary medical terminology</li> <li>Contains real-world case studies, word lists, and review questions that are designed to promote active learning</li> <li>Includes new chapters on medical reports and case studies and large animals, as well as helpful memorization features</li> <li>Provides access to a companion website with images, audio clips, flash cards, and other helpful learning tools</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>The updated second edition of the definitive guide to medical terminology for veterinary students and professionals</b> </p><p>The revised and expanded second edition of <i>Veterinary Medical Terminology Guide and Workbook, Second Edition</i> provides an introduction to the medical terms used in everyday veterinary practice.??Designed to be both comprehensive and user-friendly, the text offers easy-to-understand explanations of medical terminology and contains helpful learning features such as tips, case studies, and review questions. </p><p>The second edition features a new chapter on medical reports and case studies from practicing veterinarians and technicians, as well as expanded information on large animals, including commonly used slang in practice and a section on equine coat colors.

Remarkably few who study it contemplate what came after the armies marched away. Who would care for the tens of thousands of wounded? What happened to the thousands of dead men, horses, and tons of detritus scattered in every direction? How did the civilians cope with their radically changed lives? Gregory Coco&#x2019;s A Strange and Blighted Land. Gettysburg: The Aftermath of a Battle offers a comprehensive account of these and other issues.<br><br>The late Coco was a park ranger at Gettysburg deeply interested in the battle and what was left in its wake. The Vietnam veteran who wrote well and often about the battle waxes eloquently about the carnage of war, its terrors and pain, its irreplaceable cost in human life and treasure, and the toll it took on the families who lost sons and husbands there.<br><br>Arranged in a series of topical chapters, A Strange and Blighted Land begins with a tour of the battlefield, mostly through eyewitness accounts, of the death and destruction littering the sprawling landscape. Once the size and scope is exposed to readers, Coco moves on to discuss the dead of Gettysburg, North and South, how their remains were handled, and how and why the Gettysburg National Cemetery was established. The treatment of the wounded, Union and Confederate, was organized chaos. Every house and barn became of hospital or medical station, and the medical and surgical practices of the day were little short of compassionate torture. The author also discusses at length how prisoners were handled and the fate of the thousands of stragglers and deserters left behind once the armies left before concluding with the preservation efforts that culminated in the establishment of the Gettysburg National Military Park in 1895.<br><br>Coco&#x2019;s prose is gripping, personal, and brutally honest. There is no mistaking where he comes down on the issue: There was nothing pretty or glorious or romantic about a battle&#x2014;especially once the fighting ended.</p><p>Gregory Ashton Coco, born and raised in Louisiana, lived in the Gettysburg area for nearly 35 years. In 1972, after serving in the U.S. Army, he earned a degree in American History from the University of Southwestern Louisiana. While in the military, Greg spent a tour of duty in Vietnam as a prisoner of war military interrogator and infantry platoon radio operator with the 25th Infantry and received, among other awards, the Purple Heart and Bronze Star. During his years in Gettysburg, Greg worked as a National Park Service Ranger and a Licensed Battlefield Guide. He wrote sixteen books and a dozen scholarly articles on Gettysburg and the Civil War. His A Strange and Blighted Land. Gettysburg: The Aftermath of a Battle was voted #12 in the Top 50 Civil War Books ever written. Greg died at age 62 in February of 2009. In his words, he was &#x201c;the happy husband of Cindy L. Small for 26 years. He was the fortunate father of daughter, Keri E. Coco. He loved them both with all his heart.&#x201d; Keri is married to Cail MacLean and they have a daughter, Ashton MacLean Coco.&#x201c;...gripping, personal, and brutally honest.

A coin toss determined ownership of the yet unborn foal that was to become the first Triple Crown winner in twenty-five years, breaking and still holding all three track records. The author, who was on personal terms with Secretariat's owner, trainers, grooms, and jockey and who photographed "Big Red" throughout his career, gives us this enthralling intimate portrait - the triumphs and disasters - of Secretariat's gallop to immortality.<br><br>Secretariat was the best-known and most beloved race horse of the twentieth century. In 1973 his legacy as the greatest horse of all time was permanently etched into the consciousness of the world when he won the Triple Crown. Raymond G.

Complete with a glossary of horse-racing terms, a breakdown of Secretariat's bloodline, and a foreword by Ronald Turcotte, Secretariat's jockey during his amazing 1973 campaign, this is the definitive volume for fans of the horse and the sport of horseracing.</p><p><i>Secretariat</i>, by Raymond Woolfe, Jr., the 25th Triple Crown Anniversary Edition is a celebration of the memory of America's most beloved racing champion. The first authorized biography and chronology of the life and career of the legendary American Thoroughbred champion, <i>Secretariat</i> was originally published in 1974 immediately following his retirement from racing to stud at Claiborne Farm. The book was an instant success, favorably reviewed by NY Times, CBS TV, NBC TV, Sports Illustrated, Daily Racing Form, Time, Philadelphia Inquirer, Blood-Horse, and many other major media. Selling over 60,000 copies in its first 8 months and named to B. Dalton's prestigious "perennial list"(a tribute in the trade to a book considered to be a timeless best seller), <i>Secretariat</i> took on numbers which had been the privilege of few other books about horses. Today, book sellers specializing in out of print editions are reaping prices of from $350 upwards to $600 for first edition copies of the book. Copies signed by the author along with signatures of some or all of <i>Secretariat</i>'s entourage are valued at over $2,000 a copy. The magic of the great horse is incurable. <p>In 1989, Mr. Woolfe published a limited, leather bound collectors edition, now also out of print, which sold over 1000 copies at $250 each. The edition offered an expanded text covering <i>Secretariat</i>'s breeding career, racing records of his offspring, and a recording of Lucien Laurin's complete training diary for the horse. A groundswell of demand for a popularly priced edition of the book led Mr. Woolfe to re-publish the book for this 25th anniversary year of <i>Secretariat</i>'s Triple Crown victory. Bound in a heavy weight, full color paperback cover, the book measures in at the same coffee table size of 10 1/2" x 10 1/4" as its predecessor and contains the full expanded text of 212 pages, including 32 pages of full color (over 55 color illustrations and over 150 black &amp; white). At a suggested retail price of only $30, <i>Secretariat</i> is a prize worth having. The magic is still all there for everyone who ever loved horses, and, for those to whom horses are a lesser consideration, well, howzabout just a great story about a hero of his time.</p><b>Raymond G.

Most of these we undertook together, while she lived. Then Papa and I buried her, so that was another one checked off the list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A single merciful act eluded me: visiting those imprisoned. A lady in my position has ample opportunity to feed and clothe, but who can she call upon in gaol? Which of her genteel acquaintances is ever incarcerated?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I mentioned the difficulty to my father once, at breakfast. My words hung in the air with the steam from our tea; hot, uncomfortable. I can still see Papa's grey eyes narrow over the pages of his newspaper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Charity is not a competition, Dorothea. These "acts of mercy" - you do not need to perform them all.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'But, sir, Mama said-'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'You know your mother was a . . .' He looked down at his paper, searching for the word. 'She had odd notions about religion. You must not take what she said to heart.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We were silent a moment, feeling her absence in the empty chair at the end of the table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Mama was a Papist,' I told my toast as I buttered it. 'I am not ashamed of that.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Had I sworn before him, he could not have flushed a brighter hue. His cheeks went puce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'You are not scampering around prisons,' he barked. 'Never mind your mother - I am your father. And I say you are a Protestant. That is my final word on it.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Papa never really has the final word.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I came of age, I inherited my own money from Mama to spend as I pleased. Papa could do nothing when I decided to lay it out in improvements for prisons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Prison, along with Mama's Catholicism, was attractive to me because it was forbidden, because it was dangerous. I sat on women's prison boards, set up committees to help the poor wretches in Newgate and purchased pamphlets on Elizabeth Fry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot say these actions made me a darling of society, but I acquired friends enough for my liking: charitable spinsters, rectors' wives. Far worthier people than the fashionable young ladies Papa wished for me to associate with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'How do you expect to find a husband,' he said, 'when you are always off on these squalid sallies to gaol?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'I am fair and I have an ample dowry from Mama,' I retorted. 'If any man is fool enough to be put off by a few charitable enterprises, he does not deserve me.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So I won my way, as I always do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two years ago the Oakgate Charitable Women's Society began a project to dismantle the old, sinking hulk that passed for a penitentiary in these parts and build a new prison. That was my chance. When the women's wing was complete, the Society ruled it would be beneficial for lady visitors to call upon the inmates and improve them with edifying conversation. Naturally, I volunteered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my visits, I have seen many wretches. Desperate, friendless, craving comfort. But I have never met a criminal quite like her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was feeding Wilkie, my pet canary, this morning when the note from Matron arrived, informing me we had another one. I knew she meant the worst of all criminals: a taker of human lives. My blood began to hum. I ordered the carriage and dashed for my hat and gloves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anticipation dried my mouth as I rumbled along in the carriage towards the prison. One never knows what to expect with a murderer. When I was young, I used to imagine they all had compelling reasons to commit their deeds: a stolen lover; vengeance for a parent; betrayal; blackmail. This is a fallacy. Murder can have the strangest, most mundane of motives - or sometimes none at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I remember Mrs Blackwood, who maintained that she 'never drowned those poor dear children, it was them that came and did it, they were always killing and they always made her watch'. Then there was Miss Davies, who told me she 'bore no malice to the young black, never did mind his kind, but alas it was necessary for him to die, a sacrifice had to be made'. Most chilling of all, I think, was Mrs Wren. Yes, she had killed her husband. Did he beat her? No. Visit other women? Oh no, never. Had he in fact done anything to merit his death? Certainly, the brute - he had criticised her cooking. Not in general, no, just the once. It was enough. What wife would not kill him, she wanted to know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Phrenology is the only answer to the behavioural patterns of these women. They are born with the propensity to kill. It is all there, mapped out on the cranium. If precautions are not taken, or the wrong organs become inflamed, they give way to vice. Our society is at fault in neglecting this essential science. Had we measured the heads of these females whilst they were young, we might have averted their crime by careful instruction and conditioning. Alas, I fear the cerebral malformation has now progressed too far. And if we cannot change their characters, what hope for their souls?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>New Oakgate Prison reared up from the horizon, its stone shining white as redemption. Scaffolding covered the unfinished male wing, but within it I discerned the contours and the gaps where the windows would eventually gleam. On the women's side, we have them shaped like portholes, giving the place the feel of a great steam paddler. Saplings ring the high, iron fences. One day they shall grow and cover the exercise yard in green shade. It looks like a hopeful place, a place where perhaps all is not lost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The porters opened the gates, which did not whine or clank but glided easily on their fresh hinges. As I climbed out of the carriage and arranged my skirts, another porter met me and marked my name off in his ledger. Then came one of our warders to guide me through the limewashed corridors I know by heart, straight to the office of our principal matron.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She was sitting at her desk. When I entered she rose with a clink, drawing my eyes to the leather belt about her waist and the keys suspended from it. They did not look like instruments of incarceration. They were polished, shining with the same spanking newness of the gaol. Her office smelt fresh, of wood and lime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Miss Truelove. How prompt you are.' She offered me a curtsey and another metallic jingle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'But of course, Matron. I am all eagerness to meet our new inmate.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her face moved into an expression - I am not sure what it was, but it was certainly not a smile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matron is one of those unreadable women who fade so easily into the mechanics of an institution: age indeterminate; features regular and without distinction; voice monotonous. Even her skull remains concealed beneath a starched cap, showing no discernible bumps. If I was forced to reach a conclusion, I would say she does not like me - but of course she offers no evidence, nothing tangible for me to base this on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'I must urge you to observe caution, Miss Truelove. This one is dangerous.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thrill chased up my spine. 'Murder, I think you said?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Yes indeed.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Was it dreadfully grisly?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'No.' Her mouth tightened, but her voice did not change. 'Devious. She killed her own mistress. Slowly, by degrees.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not an act of passion, then. I yearned to ask how she committed the deed, but I reined in my curiosity. Matron is not like me; she does not question motives and hope for change. It is enough for her to ensure the women are fed and clothed - she does not appear to believe the prisoners possess souls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'A maid, I presume? What age is she?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'That is the worst of all. She is but sixteen years old.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A child!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had never met a child murderer. This would enhance my work greatly - to assess the tender skull and see if the criminal organs had already grown to their full extent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Her name?' I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Ruth Butterham.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I appreciated that plosive surname: it seemed to strike the air like a fist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Perhaps you will take me to her cell?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matron obeyed in silence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our footsteps crunched on the sanded floors, stopping finally outside a barrier of iron. Such a large door, I thought, to keep a child in. The enamel plaque swung blank - Ruth had not been there long enough to have her name and sentence inscribed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matron creaked open the iron observation flap on the door. Holding my breath, I leant forwards and peeked through.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shall never forget that first sight of her. She sat on the side of her bed, fully dressed, with a spiral of tarred rope on her lap. Her head was bent, her shoulders stooped, so I could not make out her height, but it seemed to me she was no more than the average size. Wiry black hair fell about her temples. The staff crop it short, to the chin. This helps keep the prisoners free of vermin and gives them the look of a penitent. Yet somehow the operation had the opposite effect on Ruth Butterham - she appeared to have more hair than an innocent woman, for it frizzed and expanded into a dark aureole around her head. I could not glimpse the criminal organs of the skull beneath. Perhaps the centre of Murder above the ear was engorged, but I would have to feel with my hands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I did not despair of her letting me perform such an experiment. The picture she presented was one of tranquillity. Her hands moved smoothly as she picked at clumps of oakum. Certainly, the arms were muscular, but not in a menacing way, the definition of the biceps being a natural occurrence in those who work for their bread.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'You want to talk to her, I suppose. We've been short on murderers, since the hangman took Smith.' Matron did not wait for my response before she clanked her keys and let us in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The girl glanced up as I entered. Dark eyes, framed by stubby lashes, tracked my movements. Her hands stopped their motion. The rope fell slack. I swallowed, feeling every tendon in my throat. How could she bear to hold the thing, knowing her life might end with such a rope around her neck?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Butterham, this is Miss Truelove,' said Matron. She gave a sniff that might have been disapproval. 'Come to visit you.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sat down on the one chair provided in the cell. Its legs were uneven; I had to adjust my skirts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ruth looked me full in the face. Not impertinent, precisely, but curious. I must confess to a twinge of disappointment. She was a plain creature, almost masculine, with a strong jaw and eyes set too far apart in her head. The nose was curiously flat. Flat nose, flat mind, they say. But then I have noted that murderous thoughts seldom trouble the pretty and the fashionable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'I don't know you,' she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Not yet.' I tried a smile - it felt rather foolish. She did not speak with a child's voice. Hers sounded tired, harsh. Something in its depths caused the hair on my neck to prick up. 'I come to visit all of the women. Especially those with no kin.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Well, you can suit yourself, I suppose, a rich woman like you.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She began to pick at the rope again. As her hands moved, her eyes drifted over the mug, trencher and Bible neatly laid on the windowsill. I noted how deft she was, how continually handling the oakum had stained her nails and the creases in her fingers black. 'Perhaps I do have the liberty to come and go as I please. But I do not attend for my own amusement. I come for you. To offer some comfort.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Hmm.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She did not believe a word of it. Perhaps there has been no kindness in her short life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'I'll stand outside,' said Matron. 'The observation hatch is open. No funny business, Butterham.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ruth did not deign to reply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The door clanged shut, and I was alone with the child murderer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Strange to say, I have never called upon a prisoner who had more self-possession. Grown women like Jenny Hill have sobbed on my shoulder, or begged me for mercy. Not she. This was no weeping girl, no child in need of mothering. The more she picked at the rope, the more it seemed to resemble a pile of human hair in her lap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She killed her slowly, by degrees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shook myself. I must not leap to conclusions: not all silences are sinister. After all, the crown of her head looked enlarged beneath that fuzzy hair - it might be that her organ for Dignity was overgrown. Or that she had never known the meaning of the word comfort. How could I expect her to turn her thoughts upwards and repent if she had been starved of sympathy? She needed to learn what it was to have a friend. She needed me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I cleared my throat. 'Matron calls you Butterham. It is the way of the staff here, I believe. But I should like to address you by your Christian name. You do not object to my calling you Ruth?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She shrugged. The muscles on her shoulders pulled at her serge gown. 'If you like.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Do you know why you are here, Ruth?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'I'm a murderess.' No pride in the title - little shame, either. I waited, sure of more to follow. But she just went on impassively picking, with none of that torrid explanation or madness I have come to expect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It chilled me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'And who was it that you killed?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her brow clouded. She fluttered her short lashes. 'Oh, I suppose - a great many people, miss.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was not prepared for that. Were there others the police had not discovered?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The blasted rope dust irritated my eyes, making it hard to think. Perhaps Ruth did not know the exact allegations against her? We have had instances where the enormity of a prisoner's deed wipes their mind of the incident. Had she suppressed the memory of killing her mistress? Did she merely parrot the keepers when she told me she was incarcerated for murder? I decided to tread cautiously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Indeed? And are you sorry for what you have done?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two yellow teeth worried her bottom lip. 'Yes. Well, I mean, it depends, miss.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Upon?' I could not prevent the note of incredulity that crept into that word. 'Are there qualifications for remorse?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Some I never meant to kill. The first, they were an accident.' Her voice hitched, the first crack in her facade. 'Then there were others . . . I tried to stop. I tried to stop it, but it was too late.' A sigh. 'I'm sorry for those ones. But . . .'</p></p><h2>The Message of Exodus: The Days of Our Pilgrimage (The Bible Speaks Today Series)</h2><p>When the Lord promised the land of Canaan to Abram and his descendants (Gen 15:7), every part of it was already occupied by other peoples. The long journey to possession of the Promised Land was prepared by God, yet it led through a path of adversity. We, the readers of the Old Testament, are left to wonder why. In this engaging Bible Speaks Today commentary on Exodus, J. Alec Motyer explores the character of God through his covenant promises and persistent faithfulness to the people of Israel. Through the story of Israel we are exposed to an unquenchable fire: God the Savior, the Companion and the Indweller, who will not fail those who so often fail him.</p><p>J. A. Motyer was formerly principal of Trinity College, Bristol, in England. Author of <em>The Prophecy of Isaiah,</em> he has also contributed <em>The Message of Amos, The Message of Philippians</em> and <em>The Message of James</em> to The Bible Speaks Today series.&#34;Motyer is largely successful in making the book of Exodus speak today. Motyer has clearly grappled with the Hebrew text in preparing his expositions, and thus his expositions are grounded on a scholarly analysis of the text.&#34; (Stone Campbell Journal, Spring 2007)</p><h2>Hill 488</h2><p>For some, Hill 488 was just another landmark in the jungles of Vietnam.

I had two brothers and a half-sister, but they were so much older that it was like I was an only child. Mom died when I was fifteen, which left Dad and me bacheloring it together in the rough neighborhoods of North Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was an old man by the time I reached high school. He hadn't the energy to ride herd on a rebellious teenager. I started running with a bad crowd at Rogers High School. Some might have said <i>I</i> was the bad crowd. Whichever, the cops picked me up for burglarizing a vending machine two months before graduation. That was in March 1965. A couple of other guys and I were popping Laundromat soap boxes and rifling the machines for coins.<br><br>I was seventeen and therefore no longer a juvenile, according to Oklahoma law. I went to the big boy's jail at the County Courthouse downtown. Talk about a hollow feeling when that steel door clanged behind my punk ass. I shook all over. It reminded me that I wasn't that stud I thought <br><br>I was.<br><br>Dad left me behind bars for four days to think things over before he showed up to get me out. I did a lot of thinking too. Here I was four months from being out on my own, from being an independent adult, and I was already on my way to prison.<br><br>"You're heading down a bad road, son," he said.<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"So what are you going to do about it?"<br><br>"Go in the Marines -- if they'll still have me."<br><br>Like I said, I had been doing a lot of thinking. I had wanted to be a Marine as far back as I could recall. My infatuation with the Marine Corps began after I watched an old Wallace Beery movie set during World War II. Marines were the fightingest, baddest warriors on land or sea anywhere in the world. It took a <i>real man</i> to wear the Marine Corps uniform.<br><br>"What are you going to do when you get out of school?" friends asked.<br><br>"Join the Marine Corps," I automatically responded.<br><br>Well, it was time to put up or shut up. Dad nodded in that slow way of his. The Marines were honest and honorable, and they knew how to jerk the kink out of a bad boy's tail.<br><br>"Dad?"<br><br>Dad walked away. He left me in jail one more day just for good measure. My half-brother Homer, a retired Tulsa police detective, talked him into getting me out. By the time he made my bail, I could hardly wait to run down to the nearest recruiting station. I had embarrassed my dad and embarrassed myself, but surely I could redeem myself in the Marines.<br><br>I received a deferred sentence and probation on the condition that I enlist in the Marines, if they would have me. I signed up on the delayed entry program along with a couple of high school buddies, Gary Montouri and Stephen Barnhart, which meant we were allowed to graduate from high school before shipping out to boot camp. That day I raised my hand and swore loyalty and obedience to God, country, and the Marine Corps, not necessarily in that order, and promised to rain fire and brimstone upon all enemies happened to be only two weeks after the buildup of troops began in Vietnam with the landing of the Ninth Marine Expeditionary Brigade at Da Nang on 9 March 1965.<br><br>Still, at that time, Vietnam was little more than a once-a-week footnote on <i>NBC News.</i> Vietnam was a long way off. Most people, including me, couldn't have picked it out on a map. I was little aware of how the situation was rapidly eroding and becoming a <i>real</i> war.<br><br>Things changed even more from March to July, the month I actually packed my bags and left for Oklahoma City to catch my first airplane ride to the United States Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot in San Diego, California. Viet Cong sappers crept onto the air base at Da Nang and destroyed three aircraft and wounded three Marines. Three Marines were killed and four wounded in a firefight at Duong Son. Lieutenant Frank S. Reasoner became the first Marine in South Vietnam to win the Congressional Medal of Honor, posthumously.<br><br>Walter Cronkite, "the most trusted man in America," was now talking about the war every night on the news. Friends asked me if I weren't afraid of going. Nah. There were already enough Marines in Vietnam to handle the job without adding me to the number. I could wear the good-looking uniform and have the name without the game. Besides, when you were a strapping eighteen-year-old kid a couple of inches under six feet tall and full of yourself, you thought you were going to live forever.<br><br>What I couldn't know at the time was that 1965, the year I completed Marine Corps training, would be a year of bloody fighting in the highlands between Chu Lai and Ban Me Thout -- and that I would be personally involved in the strategy of attrition announced by General William Westmoreland, Commander, U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV). That strategy, simply put, stated that we would kill more of them than they killed of us.<br><br>"We'll just go on bleeding them until Hanoi wakes up to the fact that they have bled their country to the point of national disaster for generations," he said.<br><br>That was the beginning of the practice of counting dead bodies, the all-important "body count," to keep track of how well we were doing.<br><br>My half-brother Homer saw it coming. He was a lot older than me, and a veteran of World War II as well as a retired cop. He came back from the war as a colonel with a chest full of medals.<br><br>"Don't try to be a hero," he counseled when I came home for boot camp leave. "Don't take any chances. Don't think. Act on your instincts. Expect the unexpected and always be on the alert."<br><br>It didn't take a rocket scientist to understand that the aim of Marine Corps boot camp was to emotionally strip us of our individualities and mold us back into a single functioning combat unit. A mean, lean, green fighting machine. Generations of scraggly, undisciplined youth from across the country had undergone that traumatic metamorphosis from civilian to warrior the Marine way. It started the moment the bus from the airport pulled into the Receiving Depot in San Diego and that hard hunk of mean in the drill instructor hat let you know immediately who was in charge and that you had better jump through your ass to please him.<br><br>"All right, ladies," he growled in a way that you <i>knew</i> his bite was worse than his bark. "You puke maggot pussies shut your meat traps and listen. Get off my bus and get off it now. You got five seconds, or your ass is mine."<br><br>I was off in three flat.<br><br>"That was slow, that was sloppy, your breath stinks, and you don't love Jesus. You goofy-looking maggots are gonna have to do better than that. Get with the program, pussies. Get on those yellow footsteps. Don't speak unless you're spoken to. The first word out of your mouth is 'sir,' and the last word out of your mouth is 'sir.' Is that understood, ladies?"<br><br>It was a clusterfuck of responses. The DI liaison went bugfuck, red in the face. <i>"What?"</i><br><br>I had never heard someone so proficient in the art of profanity.<br><br>"What part of that didn't you cunts understand? Let's hear it again, the right way. Is that understood, ladies?"<br><br>"Sir, yes, sir." More or less in unison.<br><br>"I can't hear you..."<br><br>Bellowing it out. "Sir, yes, sir!"<br><br>"You fucking dickheads will <i>never</i> be Marines."<br><br>I was in total shock for the first five days. Scared to hell. Every DI -- you called them <i>drill instructors</i> to their faces, as they said DI stood for <i>damned idiot,</i> which they weren't -- looked capable of taking on Man Mountain Dean and whipping his ass in the ring. I didn't sleep at all the first night. DI's yelled at us constantly. They expected us to obey and react instantly.<br><br>"You pussies gonna sleep all day?" It was still the middle of the night. "Get your asses out of them fart sacks..."<br><br>"You're getting your haircuts. Don't speak. If you got a mole or something, point to it, but keep your mouths shut..."<br><br>"Boot! What was that? Were you talking about my mother? I love my mother. Get down. <i>Get down!</i> Give me twenty pushups and every time your chest hits the ground I want to hear it..."<br><br>First, they tore you down. Then they built you back up. The Marine way.<br><br>All through basic training, DI's underplayed and understated the actual war element of the drills while stressing the mechanics of it. For all that Vietnam loomed over our shaved heads like a prophetic specter, for all that our eyes popped suddenly open at night looking into the ghost world of times to come, none of us actually <i>believed</i> we would go.<br><br>One afternoon on the firing range, a DI brought in a photo clipping from a newspaper. It showed a dead U.S. Marine lying on his back clutching a bloodstained bayonet across his chest. The picture made its silent way through the ranks. Everyone stared at it and swallowed. This dead guy wasn't much older than any of us, if at all. The war that seemed so far away suddenly became a lot closer. Something queasy stirred in the pit of my stomach, seriously disturbing my sense of immortality.<br><br>"If you guys don't pay attention in boot camp," the DI said, "this guy could be any of you."<br><br>I paid attention, but I paid <i>more</i> attention after that. My forte was the ability to shoot a rifle. I had been on the rifle team at Rogers High School. The recruit who fired the highest score received an automatic promotion to PFC, private first class. I fired expert, a 224, but I missed getting the promotion by one point. The score was high enough, however, as I found out later, to qualify me to attend Marine sniper school.<br><br>After twelve weeks of basic, Recruit Training Platoon 345 graduated fit, tanned, tough, and full of ourselves. Automatically, we were no longer "boots," "shitheads," "maggots," or "pussies."<br><br>"Today, you are <i>United States Marines."</i><br><br>Jesus, I stood tall, addressed like that for the first time. <i>Semper fi</i> and all that. Hey, I could eat the enemy for breakfast and still devour a platter of eggs, bacon, and SOS prepared by other by-God <i>United States Marines.</i> Dad was going to be proud of me. I looked forward to going on boot leave and strutting my stuff around Rogers High in my uniform. Watch out, girls.<br><br>The commander summoned a formation to read off our next duty assignments. He called us off alphabetically, followed by the duty station. I couldn't help noticing that about every other man was being sent to the Third Marine Replacement Company. <i>Replacement</i> for whom?<br><br>The alphabet reached me. "Hildreth, Raymond Stanley: Third Replacement."<br><br>Afterward, the commander explained. "For those of you assigned to the Replacement Company, that's a stop-off point in Okinawa. Congratulations. It means you're going to Vietnam."<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Ray Hildreth and Charles W.

This book completes the grim picture of slavery by showing us the origins, the nature, and the extent of slave patrols in Virginia and the Carolinas from the late seventeenth century through the end of the Civil War. Here we see how the patrols, formed by county courts and state militias, were the closest enforcers of codes governing slaves throughout the South.</p><p>Mining a variety of sources, Sally Hadden presents the views of both patrollers and slaves as she depicts the patrols, composed of "respectable" members of society as well as poor whites, often mounted and armed with whips and guns, exerting a brutal and archaic brand of racial control inextricably linked to post-Civil War vigilantism and the Ku Klux Klan. City councils also used patrollers before the war, and police forces afterward, to impose their version of race relations across the South, making the entire region, not just plantations, an armed camp where slave workers were controlled through terror and brutality.</p></p><p>Sally E.
